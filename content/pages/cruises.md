  ## Join our 'Sunset & City Lights Cruise' or 'Island Cruise'


  Step aboard one of our stylish sailing catamarans and take in the sights of
  the Gold Coast Broadwater with a Sunset or Island Cruise.    By day our Island
  Cruise offers a light lunch and Island Stop where you can enjoy activities
  including Stand Up Paddle-boarding, Inflatables, Beach Volleyball, Snorkels or
  simply relax and take a dip at Wavebreak Island.    At sunset relax on the
  boat's deck with a glass of bubbly and take in the sunset over the Gold Coast
  hinterland mountains as some cool tunes set the soundtrack.
