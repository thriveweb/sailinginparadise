  ## our story


  We sailed into the Gold Coast commercial boating scene back in 2004 and thanks
  to our loyal guests and amazing crew we are thrilled to have grown to where we
  are now, offering 2 beautiful sailing catamarans for private charters and
  cruises departing from Marina Mirage.   


  With years of commercial boating experience in Sydney and the Gold Coast
  including skippering charter boats, water taxis, jet boats and commercial jet
  skis, Sailing in Paradise owner Steve Buckley brought a new style of sailing
  experience to the Coast.   


  > "I wanted to offer an affordable luxury experience for locals and visitors
  to get out on the water and experience the Gold Coast’s beautiful waterways
  and islands.  But most of all HAVE FUN doing it! "      

  >

  > _Owner - Steve Buckley_


  After falling in love with our beautiful signature vessel ‘Spirit of Gwonda’
  (which remains one of the best catamarans on the water for social occasions)
  the dream became a reality and Sailing in Paradise was born.  


  In response to guest demand, Gwonda's sister vessel the Seawind 1000XL joined
  our fleet in 2018!


  Both boats were carefully selected to offer the same spacious deck area,
  stable sailing and beach landing capabilities.

        Sailing in Paradise was the brainchild of Steve.  Any of you who have
        sailed with Steve will probably recall his laid-back, likeable nature.
        Taking a hands-on and active involvement in the business, if you are a
        regular at the Marina you will often find him working hard during the
        week to ensure the boats are in tip-top condition for our next charter
        guests.   He also skippers the boats regularly so rest assured you will
        be well looked after with Steve as part of your crew.  A self-confessed
        gadget geek and wannabe film-maker, Steve can often be found carting
        around a plethora of gadgets including drones, 360 cameras and go-pros
        but has yet to learn how to keep them out of the water…we have lost a
        few he he…

    ## Captains


    Hi!  We are Steve and Jess and we own and manage Sailing in Paradise.  


    We realise that chartering a boat is not something that you do every day.
    Our aim is to make the entire experience as easy as possible, so that when
    you finally step aboard you can really just relax and enjoy the charter.  


    In fact, guest happiness is our highest priority.    From your first
    enquiry, through to our optional catering/beverage packages and finally to
    our welcoming crew (who we are often told feel like part of the family after
    just a few short hours) we aim to exceed your expectations.   We encourage
    you to check out our social channels and Guest Reviews (Instagram, Facebook
    and Trip Advisor links at bottom of page) to really get a vibe for what we
    are about.
