  ## our story


  We sailed into the Gold Coast commercial boating scene back in 2011 and thanks to our loyal guests and amazing crew we are thrilled to have grown to where we are now, offering 3 beautiful sailing catamarans for private charters and cruises departing from Marina Mirage.   


  With years of commercial boating experience in Sydney and the Gold Coast including skippering charter boats, water taxis, jet boats and commercial jet skis, Sailing in Paradise owner Steve Buckley brought a new style of sailing experience to the Coast.   


  > "I wanted to offer an affordable luxury experience for locals and visitors to get out on the water and experience the Gold Coast’s beautiful waterways and islands.  But most of all HAVE FUN doing it! "      

  >

  > *Owner - Steve Buckley*


  After falling in love with our beautiful signature vessel ‘Spirit of Gwonda’ (which remains one of the best catamarans on the water for social occasions) the dream became a reality and Sailing in Paradise was born.  


  In response to guest demand, our beautiful, deluxe vessel Oceans joined the fleet in 2021 and we are excited to welcome our brand new vessel Island Time (being commissioned for Sailing in Paradise) in October 2023!


  All three boats have been carefully selected to offer the same spacious deck area, stable sailing and beach landing capabilities.

    - description: Sailing in Paradise was the brainchild of Steve. Any of you who
        have sailed with Steve will probably recall his laid-back, likeable
        nature. Taking a hands-on and active involvement in the business, if you
        are a regular at the Marina you will often find him working hard during
        the week to ensure the boats are in tip-top condition for our next
        charter guests. He also skippers the boats regularly so rest assured you
        will be well looked after with Steve as part of your crew. A
        self-confessed gadget geek and wannabe film-maker, Steve can often be
        found with a plethora of gadgets such as drones, go pros and 360 cameras
        on charters.   Steve is driven by a passion for food with a keen
        interest in native Australian produce that he is hoping to align with
        the future vision for Sailing in Paradise.

    ## Captains


    Hi!  We are Steve and Jess and we own and run Sailing in Paradise.  


    We realise that chartering a boat is not something that you do every day. Our aim is to make the entire experience as easy as possible, so that when you finally step aboard you can really just relax and enjoy the charter.  


    In fact, guest happiness is our highest priority.    From your first enquiry, through to our optional catering/beverage packages and finally to our welcoming crew (who we are often told feel like part of the family after just a few short hours) we aim to exceed your expectations.   We encourage you to check out our social channels and Guest Reviews (Instagram, Facebook and Trip Advisor links at bottom of page) to really get a vibe for what we are about.
