    We have 2 of the most beautiful and well maintained sailing catamarans
    available.


    These yachts are smooth and stable and  perfect for entertaining.


    Imagine yourself lazing in the sun on the trampoline style foredeck with a
    cocktail in hand or relaxing with friends in the undercover area, either way
    you will enjoy unobstructed views of the beautiful Gold Coast Broadwater and
    surrounds.


    Everything is taken care of - the coolest tunes playing through state of the
    art sound system with speakers inside and out, large eskies stocked with
    ice, large central timber table for presenting your food, marine barbecue,
    inflatables, paddleboards and beach games, clean modern bathroom facilities,
    the list goes on and on.


    And our crew are on hand to ensure that your event is the best it can be.


    From your initial enquiry all the way through to your special day and
    beyond, we go out of our way to ensure your expectations are not only met
    but exceeded.


    We know organising an event can sometimes be stressful, but Sailing In
    Paradise's Guest Relations Gurus will take away the stress and replace it
    with fun.


    On the day you will be greeted with smiles.. and good times will follow.
