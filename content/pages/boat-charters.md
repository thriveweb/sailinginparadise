  ## Private Boat Hire


  If you are looking for a private boat hire on the Gold Coast, welcome, we are glad you found us!  


  We invite you to join us on one of our luxury sailing catamarans. Suitable for any occasion including hen’s parties, birthday parties, corporate events, family get-togethers, weddings or just for a day out with friends.


  What better way to celebrate any occasion than with a sail on the beautiful Gold Coast Broadwater?


  Perhaps you are after a relaxing romantic sail or have a proposal in mind? Or maybe you want to remember a loved one with a special on-water memorial. We have the right boat and the perfect crew for any occasion.


  Catamarans are becoming increasingly popular due to their stability, wide deck spaces and smooth cruising, making them perfect for social occasions.   A **sailing** **catamaran** is the epitome of style and guaranteed to offer some great photo opportunities captured by our on-board crew. There is nothing quite as relaxing as hoisting the sails, switching off the motors and gliding along the smooth clear waters while lazing on the trampolines under a sunny blue sky.
