      Our original and signature vessel, the ‘Spirit Of Gwonda’ is a Seawind
      1050 Resort sailing catamaran which has been purpose built for
      entertaining and day cruises.    With no need for bedrooms this allows for
      extra deck space to accommodate up to 30 guests.


      The clever and unique design of this vessel offers a completely open plan layout so your guests can interact with each other at all times whether inside or outside the vessel.  


      Of course we still offer all the luxuries you would expect including the ever-popular front trampoline sections for soaking up the sun, generous inside bench seating with our largest undercover area and a central table, barbecue and renovated bathroom facilities.


      This is the ideal boat for larger groups and it's our ultimate 'party boat'.  Spirit of Gwonda is also wonderful for families with small children.  


      Measuring 10.5m long by 6.5m wide, there is ample space for up to 30 people (plus 2 crew), approx 60 square metres of deck space in fact.  You will be amazed at the room available inside this smooth and stable boat, making it ideal for social occasions of all kinds.   Spirit Of Gwonda is truly unique and the only one of it’s kind on the Gold Coast.
