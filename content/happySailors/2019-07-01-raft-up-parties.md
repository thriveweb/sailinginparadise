  "We booked sailing in paradise for our end of season footy trip. The crew
  aboard were amazing and having 2 photographers aboard, that meant we could ask
  to get our photo taken anytime we liked. Highly recommend.” TripAdvisor

The Maroochydore Roo women’s team celebrated their end of season footy trip with us. Having over 30 guests we split the teams across our two boats and sailed in convoy to meet up at Wave Break Island for some beach activities. It was especially fun to see the dance off between the two boats at sunset as we sailed back only a meter or so apart from each other.
