  Had a beautiful sunset cruise that was relaxed from start to finish! Our
  topless waiter was a real treat for guests and an absolute laugh! Water
  conditions were perfect and we even had some dolphin friends pop up to say
  hello!

  Anthony and Sandy (staff on board) were lovely and very accommodating, and
  Jess was a pleasure to organise with! Thanks again! Trip Advisor Review

Sunset is our favourite time to be out on the water, it's hard to beat when you have your favourite people around you to share it with (and bubbles of course)! Just like most of our guests who sail at sunset, Ally and her guests got a bit more dressed up and were ready to let the fun continue in town afterwards! To be honest, our guests are never in a hurry to leave us when the cruise comes to an end, too busy enjoying themselves!
