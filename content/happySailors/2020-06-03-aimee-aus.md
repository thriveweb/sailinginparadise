excerpt: '"Amazing experience for my Hens Party. Thank-you to the staff that
  assisted with my booking enquiry which was a seamless experience, to the day
  of the cruise where Ella, Steve and Pete ensured my friends, family and I had
  the most memorable experience. The staff were professional and friendly at all
  times and photographed the entire day so that we could focus on having fun the
  whole time. Thank you from the bottom of my heart for providing us with such a
  fantastic day!!!" Google Review'

It was our pleasure to have bride-to-be, Aimee and her guest on board with us! As we are with all of our guests, we were delighted to make it an unforgettable experience for them!  We do understand that sometimes there can be a lot of pressure when it comes to planning a henâ€™s party, which is why we aim to make a simple and easy booking process, just like it was for Aimee. Have a peek at the photos below to see how their charter went!
