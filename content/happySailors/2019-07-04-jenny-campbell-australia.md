  “We had a sunset cruise for my daughters hens night on Saturday night. I can
  highly recommend this company as an excellent party boat. The food & service
  was amazing. They are so flexible with making this a no stress event. We
  booked the butler in the buff as a last minute this was money well spent he
  made us all feel comfortable & helped everyone to mix...good work Pete. Thanks
  again Sailing in Paradise that was a night that won't be forgotten.” Facebook

Having a butler surprise your guests always goes down well at our hens parties! It’s a popular option and can make a big difference to your experience, like how it did for Jenny’s daughters hen’s party. It can be a great way to get the celebrations started and break the ice with your guests. Our Butler will not only serve you drinks but also pose for photos and play hens party games!
