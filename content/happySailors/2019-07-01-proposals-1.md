  “My partner and best friend organised a birthday boat party for me, which
  turned into an absolutely fantastic PROPOSAL in the end!! Everything from
  start to finish was wonderful and expertly planned, from the music that was
  organised to the words ‘will you marry me’ on the sail as we sailed away - the
  staff did everything to make sure it was all perfect and gave us some
  beautiful memories with a professional photographer onboard too! Thank you so
  much again to all the staff involved in making sure the day was perfect”

Nothing makes us smile more than a secret proposal on board! It was such a beautiful moment when Daniel went down on one knee and Lauren realized what was happening. We are so honoured to assist in making this special occasion perfect and unforgettable for Lauren and Daniel.
