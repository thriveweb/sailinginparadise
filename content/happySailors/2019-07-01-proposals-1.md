excerpt: “My partner and best friend organised a birthday boat party for me,
  which turned into an absolutely fantastic PROPOSAL in the end!! Everything
  from start to finish was wonderful and expertly planned, from the music that
  was organised to the words ‘will you marry me’ on the sail as we sailed away -
  the staff did everything to make sure it was all perfect and gave us some
  beautiful memories with a professional photographer onboard too! Thank you so
  much again to all the staff involved in making sure the day was perfect”
