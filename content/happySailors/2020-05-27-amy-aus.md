Amy organised her friends hen's party with us, it was a day full of smiles and blue skies. We set up SUP's and cute inflatables for her guests to enjoy while we were pulled up on the sand at the secluded Wave Break Island. Check out the gallery below to see how crystal clear the water was that day!
