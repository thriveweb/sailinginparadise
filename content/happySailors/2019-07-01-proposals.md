  “Amazing scenery, very comfortable boat and really friendly professional
  staff, we had a fantastic time and the crew made it a very memorable occasion.
  We saw dolphins and other various marine life and the cruise back looking at
  the lights of the coast was spectacular. would defiantly recommend to anyone
  thinking of doing this.”

Matthew organised a special sunset proposal charter to pop the question to Jessica. At the perfect moment and to Jessica’s surprise, we pulled out the sail which said “will you marry me” while playing a special song of hers. The dolphins visiting made it even more perfect! We absolutely adore hosting proposals and have a 100% success rate!
