excerpt: “Amazing scenery, very comfortable boat and really friendly
  professional staff, we had a fantastic time and the crew made it a very
  memorable occasion. We saw dolphins and other various marine life and the
  cruise back looking at the lights of the coast was spectacular. would
  defiantly recommend to anyone thinking of doing this.”
