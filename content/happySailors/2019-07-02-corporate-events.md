excerpt: Tash – “This sunset cruise comes highly recommended. Jess from Sailing
  in Paradise was excellent to deal with and very accommodating! The team were
  highly flexible and was able to set sail from the Sanctuary Cove rather than
  Surfers Paradise, very accommodating for the private group. Food, hospitality
  and cruise was FANTASTIC! Cannot recommend this highly enough especially for
  Corporate.10/10!” TripAdvisor
