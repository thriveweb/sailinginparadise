excerpt: “WOW! What a day out!! We had 10 girls from Melbourne up for a Hens
  party, and Steve and the team really know how to host a day on the water. With
  an onboard photographer, it was great to not have to worry about capturing
  photos and enjoy ourselves. We received the photos the same or the very next
  day, efficient!!! such an amazing and fun day, I couldn't recommend this sail
  more. The boat was amazing, so much room for activities. Keep up the good work
  Steve! I will be recommending you to anyone heading up to the GC!!”

    charter, afternoon charters are a great option if you want to soak up the
    sun in your bikini's or dive into the sparking turquoise water at Wave Break

Harriet celebrated her hen's party with us on a private afternoon charter, afternoon charters are a great option if you want to soak up the sun in your bikini's or dive into the sparking turquoise water at Wave Break Island for some swimming and SUP’s! We loved their themed swimmers and helping to create a fun day for everyone!
