excerpt: '"This cruise was a great way to spend the afternoon taking in the
  views and relaxing in the sun. The crew was very friendly and obliging. It was
  fun on the island using the SUPs and floats. The highlight was seeing a
  dolphin pod close up as we returned from the island.‚Äù TripAdvisor'

Our Island cruise suits those seeking a relaxing afternoon in the sunshine and those after some awesome fun! Mr Apple and his group enjoyed a blissful afternoon relaxing on the trampoline style fore-deck as well as making use of our beach activities at the picturesque Wave Break Island. The highlight was having the friendly dolphins come to say hello!
