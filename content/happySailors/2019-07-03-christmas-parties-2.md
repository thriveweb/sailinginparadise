  Jade – “Organising my event with Sailing in Paradise was made super easy
  thanks to their helpful staff. They promptly replied to all of my emails and
  answered every question I threw at them. The crew onboard were just as helpful
  and soooo friendly...they felt like apart of our group after just 3hrs. I’m
  sure I will be joining them again sometime, for another fun and relaxing time
  on the water.” Facebook

Jade from Raceview State School organized a morning private charter with us for her Christmas party event. Morning charters are an amazing time to get out on the water, especially if you want some beach time. We love being apart of our guests special occasions and love making them feel welcome!
