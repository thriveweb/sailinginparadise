excerpt: Jade – “Organising my event with Sailing in Paradise was made super
  easy thanks to their helpful staff. They promptly replied to all of my emails
  and answered every question I threw at them. The crew onboard were just as
  helpful and soooo friendly...they felt like apart of our group after just
  3hrs. I’m sure I will be joining them again sometime, for another fun and
  relaxing time on the water.” Facebook
