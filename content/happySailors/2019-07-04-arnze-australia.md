  “Had a fantastic time with Sailing in Paradise! A very friendly welcome from
  the captain and Chanelle! We went on a three-hour voyage, rules were explained
  quick and simple. Stopped at a quiet spot at wave break island, had our own
  food and relaxed with the paddle boards and inflatables! Afterwards, we
  continued round back to the Marina Mirage. The photographer had the photos out
  within the same day, had an amazing experience and made some great memories!”

Arnze attended a private afternoon charter with us for a fun way to get friends together for a day they wont stop talking about! His group opted for BYO which is a great way to bring your favourite dishes or use the onboard BBQ. The choice is yours!
