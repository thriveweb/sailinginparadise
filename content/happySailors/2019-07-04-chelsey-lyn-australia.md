  “I have sailed with Sailing in Paradise at both sunrise and sunset. Both times
  offered two very different experiences. The morning cruise was swimming and
  sun baking while the evening cruise was champagne and dancing. I highly
  recommend Sailing in Paradise for both experience and service.” Facebook
