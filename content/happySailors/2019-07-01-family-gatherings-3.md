  “We made booking after reviewing others' comments and I am so glad I book with
  them, we chartered for 4 hours, we are a group of family with 11 people, 3
  small kids, 7 adults and 1 elderly and everyone enjoyed the trip so much. We
  had fishing, paddle boarding and kids playing on the beach. Steve and Phoebe
  made our entire outing very pleasant. They were both very nice with great
  hospitality. Everything was delivered as promised! Superb!” TripAdvisor

Our catamarans are ideal for families and suit young and elderly guests. There is huge deck space that makes it perfect for social gatherings. Lowan and his family organized an afternoon charter which was perfect for some family friendly beach activities at Wave Break Island, they even caught a fish which was the highlight!
