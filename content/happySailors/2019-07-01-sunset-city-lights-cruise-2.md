  “Accommodating and very friendly the entire time. Boat is very stable and even
  though I can experience motion sickness I didn’t on this boat. Nice photos
  too. The winter sunset is perfect and they offered blankets.

If you are like Rich and can experience motion sickness, don’t worry! On our beautiful, smooth and stable catamarans you can sit back, relax and enjoy the best waterfront sunset views as we sail the calm and clear waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. (You wont be needing the ginger!)
