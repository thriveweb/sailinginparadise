excerpt: "\"To celebrate my father's 70th Birthday I wanted to do something
  different, and Dad loved sailing in his younger years, so what better way to
  celebrate than on a catamaran? Anthony (Skipper), Chanelle and Anna were just
  pure class. They were incredibly polite and professional, and nothing during
  the cruise was too much.  We had a party of 7 which included one child (son),
  and he was made to feel right at home. When it came time to hoist the jib,
  both my father and son were asked to assist, which made for some great photos
  that will be cherished. I cannot recommend Sailing in Paradise Gold Coast
  highly enough. If we could give them 10 stars, we would. Value for money was
  bloody brilliant.\""
