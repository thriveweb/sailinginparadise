excerpt: “AMAZING that is the only way to describe the service provided by Steve
  and Jess. Not only did they take 50 people out for a sail to Wave break Island
  and then on a sunset cruise but they organised an extra boat to accommodate
  our large party, organised buses to pick up the partygoers, picked up the
  alcohol, organised the food and we can't forget the dolphins! It was an
  experience that 50 people will never forget. Thank you so much for your
  incredible patience with the constant changes to the plans. Amazing!!”

If you have a larger group like Margaret from Funky Trunks did, we can easily arrange additional vessels for a “raft up” party, you can then take up to 90 guests! The more the merrier and no one gets left out! This occasion was for a special birthday party celebration and they had the biggest game of beach cricket we had ever seen!
