  “AMAZING that is the only way to describe the service provided by Steve and
  Jess. Not only did they take 50 people out for a sail to Wave break Island and
  then on a sunset cruise but they organised an extra boat to accommodate our
  large party, organised buses to pick up the partygoers, picked up the alcohol,
  organised the food and we can't forget the dolphins! It was an experience that
  50 people will never forget. Thank you so much for your incredible patience
  with the constant changes to the plans. Amazing!!”

If you have a larger group like Margaret from Funky Trunks did, we can easily arrange additional vessels for a “raft up” party, you can then take up to 90 guests! The more the merrier and no one gets left out! This occasion was for a special birthday party celebration and they had the biggest game of beach cricket we had ever seen!
