excerpt: “AMAZING, that is the only way to describe the service provided by
  Steve and Jess. Not only did they take 50 people out for a sail to Wave Break
  Island and then on a sunset cruise, but they organised an extra boat to
  accommodate our large party, organised buses to pick up the partygoers, picked
  up the alcohol, organised the food and we can't forget the dolphins! It was an
  experience that 50 people will never forget. Thank you so much for your
  incredible patience with the constant changes to the plans. Amazing!”

    can easily arrange additional vessels for a “raft up” party, you can then
    take up to 90 guests! "
