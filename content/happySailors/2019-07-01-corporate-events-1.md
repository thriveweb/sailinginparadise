  Mary - “Great team outing - comfortable vessel with all the necessary
  amenities. The crew were a great fit, and ensured we had everything we needed.
  We especially loved that the crew had a camera on board to snap all our fun.
  Was a beautiful day out - highly recommend!” TripAdvisor

Simpro organized their end of year annual corporate event with us. It was a wonderful way for their team to come together out of the office for a blissful afternoon in the sun and something different that everyone would enjoy!
