excerpt: “I engaged services of Sailing in Paradise for my boyfriend's surprise
  40th Birthday Party. The Sailing in Paradise team and crew were extremely
  helpful and accommodating for all our needs. They assisted us with organising
  the catering and provided eskies with ice for our own alcohol. Sailing was
  beautiful and boat was very luxurious and clean. We were taken to an island
  where the crew set up a beach volleyball and cricket for us, so we enjoyed
  some activities as well as sailing. Everyone had a fantastic time. Plus, we
  were given complimentary photos to memorise this wonderful day, as we all had
  too much fun to remember to take photos ourselves. I highly recommend Sailing
  in Paradise.” Facebook review

We love surprise birthdays! Kalina organized an afternoon private charter with us to celebrate her boyfriend’s 40th birthday. The excitement was felt as we all watched her lead the blindfolded birthday boy to the boat while playing his favourite song. Kalina opted for catering with a private chef, an ideal option for stress-free planning. While lunch was all being taken care of by the chef, Kalina and her guests were out there having a blast and showed us one of the best volleyball rallies’ we have ever seen!
