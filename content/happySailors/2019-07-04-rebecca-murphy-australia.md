excerpt: "“My friends arranged for my Hen's party with Sailing in Paradise. Each
  and every aspect of the entire 3-hour sunset cruise exceeded my expectations.
  The staff, cleanliness of the catamaran and general organisation of the event
  was amazing. The team think about everything! They have you covered from the
  little things like providing ample esky storage and ice to a Bluetooth
  speaker. Not to mention the cruise comes with a photographer!“ "
