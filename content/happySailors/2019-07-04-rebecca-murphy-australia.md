  “My friends arranged for my Hen's party with Sailing in Paradise. Each and
  every aspect of the entire 3 hour sunset cruise exceed my expectations. The
  staff, cleanliness of the catamaran and general organisation of the event was
  amazing. The team think about everything! They have you covered from the
  little things like providing ample esky storage and ice to a bluetooth
  speaker. Not to mention the cruise comes with a photographer! “  Facebook

Rebecca’s friends organized a sunset charter with us for her hen's party, sunset is a beautiful time to be out on the water and are a great way to get the night started! Our guests like to get a bit more dressed up at night and hit the town afterwards, although it’s quite common  they don’t want to get off at the end!
