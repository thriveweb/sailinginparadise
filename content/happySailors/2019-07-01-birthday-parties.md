excerpt: “Absolutely incredible! We booked a catamaran with sailing in paradise,
  and from start to finish we couldn’t fault a single thing. Jess who took my
  last-minute booking was so lovely to deal with, the boat was way more than any
  of us expected it was GORGEOUS, the crew on board couldn’t have been nicer.
  The whole experience gave my husband one of the best birthdays he’s ever had,
  and us and our friends had an absolute blast � we will be back!!” Facebook
