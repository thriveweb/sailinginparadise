excerpt: '"Sailing in Paradise delivered a wonderful experience my guests and I
  on the Spirit of Gwonda as I celebrated a big milestone! The feedback from all
  my guests was that it was a great night and we all had the best time.  From a
  personal perspective, Jess took all the stress away from organising the event.
  The service and offerings along with a beautiful cruise of the Broadwater
  exceeded my expectations. I appreciate everything they did for me and will
  definitely recommend Sailing in Paradise to everybody and look forward to
  enjoying another charter sometime soon." Trip Advisor'
