  "Sailing in Paradise delivered a wonderful experience my guests and I on the
  Spirit of Gwonda as I celebrated a big milestone! The feedback from all my
  guests was that it was a great night and we all had the best time.  From a
  personal perspective, Jess took all the stress away from organising the event.
  The service and offerings along with a beautiful cruise of the Broadwater
  exceeded my expectations. I appreciate everything they did for me and will
  definitely recommend Sailing in Paradise to everybody and look forward to
  enjoying another charter sometime soon." Trip Advisor

It makes us so happy to help our guests celebrate their amazing achievements in life! We strive to create a memorable experience for them, just like it was for Marisa who organised a private charter with us to celebrate her graduation.
