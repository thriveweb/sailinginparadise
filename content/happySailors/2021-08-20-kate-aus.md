We had the best time looking after Kate and her family for her birthday! We had all the beach equipment out for the kids, they were completely in their element on the island! Kate booked Spirit of Gwonda which is the perfect boat for young children mainly due to the easier way of accessing the front of the boat from the back.  Check out the photos below and read about Kates experience with us below...
