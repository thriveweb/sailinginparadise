  “This was one of the best days I’ve had in a while. Wanted to do something a
  little different for my best friends hens party.  The whole team at sailing in
  paradise are so lovely and helpful. We docked because we ran out of alcohol
  (thank god we could dock for more hahah)  We also got to go for a swim on the
  floaties and sup boards! Music, dancing and some amazing views. Highly
  recommended! Thank you so much to the team for helping execute an amazing hens
  party!!” Tripadvisor
