excerpt: '"We did our cruise on the 22nd of June with family visiting from the
  states - we absolutely loved our sailing excursion. The food, drink, service
  and entire experience was exactly what we were hoping for. The photos were an
  added bonus-it made it so that we didn’t need to hold our phones for photos.
  Would definitely book again! Thank you."'
