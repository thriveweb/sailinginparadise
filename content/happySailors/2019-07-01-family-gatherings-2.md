  “We did our cruise on the 22nd of June of this year with family visiting from
  the states-we absolutely loved our sailing excursion. The food, drink, service
  and entire experience was exactly what we were hoping for. The photos were an
  added bonus-it made it so that we didn’t need to hold our phones for photos.
  Would definitely book again! Thank you.” Facebook Review

If you’re visiting the Gold Coast, getting out on the water really is a must do! Sailing has a way of bringing everyone together, Lydia has organized a few family gatherings with us with her international guests. Taking them to the beautiful Wave Break Island and sailing around the picturesque Broadwater makes for an unforgettable Gold Coast experience!
