  Suzy – “This is the 2nd year that we have used Jess & Steve @ Sailing in
  Paradise for our staff Christmas Party and once again they did not disappoint!
  The yacht was immaculate, staff amazing, food completely delicious and we even
  were accommodated with being lucky enough to share some GC fireworks while on
  the water! If you’re unsure on what to do for your next get together... Call
  Jess and chat- you will have the most amazing time with this crew!”

We love hosting Christmas parties and are honoured when our clients come back the next year like Suzy from Better Living Australia. Suzy organized an extra surprise treat for her colleagues, and we stayed out longer so they could watch the GC fireworks from the water, it complimented the Christmas party occasion perfectly.
