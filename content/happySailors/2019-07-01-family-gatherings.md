excerpt: “Steve, Jessica and the team provided a fantastic experience for our
  family. The lunch was superb, Steve interacted with the kids to get them
  involved in getting the sails up which they loved. They took some amazing
  pictures which was all part of the service, not a chargeable extra. I can't
  recommend them enough.” Facebook review
