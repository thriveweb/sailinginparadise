Mbo treated her family to an afternoon Island cruise, the young ones loved when our crew got them involved with hoisting the sails as we made our way to the beautiful and secluded Wave Break Island. Our Island cruise comes with a complimentary light lunch and icy cold beverage, so you only really need to remember to bring along your towel/swimmers, how easy!
