  "My bridesmaids surprised me with my hens party with Sailing In Paradise and I
  seriously had the best time! They were so helpful and my MoH said that they
  made organising it super easy as they were very helpful and accommodating. We
  cruised around the Broadwater and then stopped on an island and went for a
  swim. They had floaties and SUP's that we could use. They also had a camera
  and took plenty of pictures and sent them all to us via email as well! Would
  definitely love to go on another sail with them! Thanks for everything guys!"

We love a themed hen's party! Salkia and her entourage rocked a fun tropical theme, perfect for a summery party vibe! We know that every hen's party is different and whatever your ultimate hens's party may be, we will always aim to give our guests the best experience possible from beginning until end.
