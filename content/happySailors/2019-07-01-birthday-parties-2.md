  “Highly recommend this company. I had impeccable customer service from
  beginning till the end. Jess rescheduled my cruise after we experienced
  cancelled flights - she’s amazing she went above & beyond! The staff on the
  cruise were fantastic, my family and I had the best time celebrating my 40th.
  There’s so many facilities to use & we made the most of them. Playing a
  competitive game of volleyball to swimming and paddle boarding. We really
  enjoyed our time. My highlight of my 40th holiday was being aboard Sailing in
  Paradise with my family, friends and their amazing staff .... FROM THE BOTTOM
  OF MY HEART. THANK YOU FOR MAKING MY BIRTHDAY A MEMORABLE ONE.  All my friends
  on the GC, book your next event with this company! I promise you’ll have the
  experience of a lifetime ❤️” Facebook review

Sia flew up from (Melbourne?) to celebrate her 40th birthday with us. Sometimes mother nature can bring along a little rain as it did on this charter, but that didn’t stop the celebrations for Sia and her guests! Even though we have ample undercover area these guys just wanted to get out there and have a blast dancing in the rain and taking advantage of the beach activities. We love making memorable and stress-free experiences for our guests and especially loved watching them singing their hearts out together!
