  “I highly recommend Sailing In Paradise! Had my sister’s hens party with them
  on Saturday - it was the best day ever!! The crew were fantastic and the
  planning process was so easy, they always got back to me in a timely manner.
  Do yourself a favour and book a cruise with Sailing In Paradise - 10/10”

We absolutely love hosting hen's party charters, and hen's parties love us too! It’s kind of our speciality! Lauren organized an afternoon charter for her sister's hen's party which was a stress-free and easy process!
