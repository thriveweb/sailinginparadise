RVCA organized a sunset cruise private charter to celebrate their Christmas party in a unique and unforgettable way. The sunset charters are a great way to get the night started, especially if your group will be hitting the town afterwards to continue the celebrations! Organized catering is also a great option for easy planning and not having to worry about what to bring and pack up at the end.
