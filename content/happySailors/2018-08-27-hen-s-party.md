excerpt: "Tahlia - The whole day was amazing. The staff were absolutely
  exceptional and made my mum's birthday run so smoothly, they both had
  professional yet very warm & calming attitudes. And every single person who
  came has commented on how fantastic they were.   "

Tahlia organised a beautiful afternoon on the Broadwater with family to celebrate a very special family birthday!   With littlies on board the whole family enjoyed a swim stop at Wavebreak Island with Stand Up Paddleboarding and Sand Castle Building the highlights...   A special mention must go to the beautiful birthday cake hand baked by Tahlia - wow!   Happy birthday Leigh!
