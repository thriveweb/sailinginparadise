excerpt: “We did the 2-hour sunset cruise and very glad we did! The Catamaran
  was clean and spacious. The staff were friendly and provided us with a
  complimentary drink and nibbles, some stunning photographs and chill vibing
  tunes as we sailed into the sunset. A must do on the Gold Coast!” TripAdvisor

Whether you’re visiting our beautiful Gold Coast from overseas or a local or like Sandy, our Sunset and City Lights Cruise is a great way to see the Gold Coast from a different perspective. The twinkling city lights look magical from the water after the sun goes down.
