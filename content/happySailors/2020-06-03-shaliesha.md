  "I booked a 3 hours sunset cruise for my friends hens party, it was amazing.
  We can’t thank the crew enough for their amazing service and laid back nature.
  They actually felt like they were apart of the party which is an amazing way
  to feel. the scenery is amazing were they cruise and the boat was very clean
  and had amazing picture opportunities. A butler in the buff is a must. Once
  again 5/5 star service, super friendly staff, super accommodating and
  flexible. can’t recommend enough. Thank you guys"

We love how no hen’s party is the same and each one has their own vibe! Shaleisha and her guests chose a chic all white theme, when this is teamed with a sunset and scenic views it can make very insta-worthy photos! Our crew will take photos of you on the day as a souvenir to look back on and so you don’t have to always worry about capturing every moment yourself.
