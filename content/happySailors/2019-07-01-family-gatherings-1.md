  “Fantastic day out on the water. Staff very friendly. Enjoyed utilising their
  SUP blow up toys and beach cricket �. Kids loved it very safe for kids.
  Catamaran was very smooth on the water no one got seasick. Would definitely
  recommend to anyone looking for a group activity as it seats up to 30 there
  was only 10 of us. Very roomy inside and toilet provided.” Facebook review
