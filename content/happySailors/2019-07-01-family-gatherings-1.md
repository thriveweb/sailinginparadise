  “Fantastic day out on the water. Staff very friendly. Enjoyed utilising their
  SUP blow up toys and beach cricket �. Kids loved it very safe for kids.
  Catamaran was very smooth on the water no one got seasick. Would definitely
  recommend to anyone looking for a group activity as it seats up to 30 there
  was only 10 of us. Very roomy inside and toilet provided.” Facebook review

If you have guests who may get seasick like Alicia’s group, don’t worry our skippers ensure a safe and comfortable sailing experience. Our catamarans are renowned for their smooth and stable rides ensuring no motion sickness for your guests. You can spend your time socialising or relaxing on the trampoline style foredeck while we sail to Wave Break Island for some family friendly beach activities and sandcastles for the little ones!
