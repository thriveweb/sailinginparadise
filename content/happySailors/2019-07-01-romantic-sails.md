  “The sunset cruise was absolutely perfect to surprise my wife with a different
  kind of date while childless for the weekend. The SIP crew were very friendly
  and relaxed, making for an enjoyable experience. The knowledge of local
  scenery and precise timing of the cruise allowed for many brilliant photos
  with hardly any filters required. The dolphins coming out to play was the
  cherry on the cake! Will definitely be back when it’s time to forget life and
  chill out again!” Facebook review
