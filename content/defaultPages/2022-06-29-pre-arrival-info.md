  Your charter is just around the corner and we look forward to welcoming you onboard :) We have put together some essential pre-charter info to help get you ready for a totally stress-free and seamless experience! 


  ###### I﻿mportant requirements for party guests.


  N﻿o straight spirits are permitted on board the vessel (commercial premix spirits cans or bottles only).   Any spirits bottles will need to be surrendered to crew and will be returned at the end of the charter - sorry!!


  The marina does not permit the drinking of alcohol, or any loud or disorderly behaviour.  We also cannot welcome any already intoxicated guests on board the boat so please hold off on cracking open those drinks until you get on the boat. In the event that any guests become overly intoxicated on the charter it may be necessary to  end the charter early and drop guests at the nearest wharf.

  ###### BOARDING INFO


  \- **Boarding is 10 mins prior** to your scheduled departure time. If you arrive earlier than this we ask that you please meet your group at the top, main boardwalk and wait there until your scheduled boarding time. The Marinas are very narrow, so it can be unsafe for large groups to congregate near the boats. At your scheduled boarding time 10 mins prior to departure, please make your way  to the vessel where our crew will be waiting for you. 


  \- Please bring any food, drinks, any marine-safe, non staining decorations etc with you on arrival.   On most occasions we are unfortunately unable to accept early deliveries due to the vessel's schedule and lack of storage space


  ###### WHAT TO BRING


  \- Filtered water is available on board the vessels.  We suggest bringing a reusable water bottle.  


  \- For BYO guests, bottled drinks such as champagne, cruisers, beers etc are welcome. **Red wine and straight bottles of spirits are not permitted**, but you are welcome to bring along commercial pre-mixed spirits/RTDs.  


  **\- Please remember to bring any non-breakable cups, plates and cutlery etc as required for BYO food and drinks as we don't carry these on board.**  We will provide eskies with ice for your use.  


  \- We welcome any attire on board the vessels so please dress however you feel comfortable to suit the theme of your charter, whether than be a T-Shirt and shorts or cocktail attire.  On winter evenings a jacket is advisable. 


  \- No shoes, no worries!  We offer a relaxed, barefoot sailing experience for your safety and comfort on board.     **You will be asked to slip your shoes off prior to boarding and leave your worries at the dock.**   


  \- If you are sailing during the day and are planning to go for a swim or enjoy our complimentary beach activities, be sure to remember your beach towel, swimmers and sunscreen (slip, slop, slap!) 


  \- A friendly reminder that there is **no smoking** permitted onboard our vessels. Our crew can organise a smoking stop for any guests on request, please let them know at the start of your charter. 


  If you still have any unanswered questions or are unsure of something, please feel free to give us a call on 0438 915 222 or drop us an email at info@sailinginparadise.com.au.  


  We can't wait to welcome you on board.   


  See you soon!  :-)
