INTRODUCTION\r\n\nAdventures in Paradise Pty Ltd (ACN 166 501 622) (t/a Sailing in Paradise, we, our, us) recognises the importance of protecting the privacy and the rights of individuals in relation to their personal information. This Privacy Policy sets out our commitment to protecting the privacy of your personal information that we collect through this website (Site) or directly from you. We respect the privacy of personal information you may provide to us. The way we manage your personal information is governed by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) (“Act”) and the National Privacy Principles (“NPPs”) established under the Act. We also uphold your rights to privacy if you are based in the European Union, in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU).  Your rights under the GDPR are listed in clause 16. If you do not wish to provide personal information to us, then you do not have to do so.  However, this may affect your use of this Site or any products and services offered on it.\r\n\n2. WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?\r\n\nWhen used in this privacy policy, the term “personal information” has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act and GDPR.  In general terms, it is any information that can be used to personally identify you. This may include your name, address, telephone number, email address and profession or occupation.  If the information we collect personally identifies you, or you are reasonably identifiable from it, the information will be considered personal information. We may also collect some information that is not personal information because it does not identify you or anyone else.  For example, we may collect anonymous answers to surveys or aggregated information about how users use our website. Your personal information will not be shared, sold, rented or disclosed other than as described in this privacy policy.\r\n\n3.

We collect, hold, use and disclose your personal information for the following purposes:\r\n\n•\tTo provide our services to you\r\n\n•\tTo conduct internal record keeping\r\n\n•\tTo identify and understand your needs\r\n\n•\tTo send communications requested by you\r\n\n•\tTo answer enquiries and provide information or advice about existing and new services\r\n\n•\tTo conduct market research, business development and marketing activities (including direct marketing)\r\n\n•\tTo provide you with access to protected areas of our website\r\n\n•\tTo customise, improve and ensure proper functioning of our website\r\n\n•\tTo run competitions or offer additional benefits to you\r\n\n•\tTo send you promotional information about third parties that we think you may find interesting\r\n\n•\tTo comply with any law, rule, regulation, lawful and binding determination, decision or direction of a regulator, or in co-operation with any governmental authority\r\n\nIf you do not provide us with your personal information, it is generally not possible for us to provide you with the products or services you have requested. Where it is lawful and practical to do so, we may allow you to deal with us anonymously. We do not use ‘Identifiers’ to identify your personal information in our systems. An “identifier” is a unique identification number assigned to you by the Commonwealth Government or a Commonwealth Government Agency. Examples of identifiers include your Tax File Number (TFN) or Medicare number.\r\n\n4.

WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CAN’T COLLECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?\r\n\nIf you do not provide us with the personal information described above, some or all of the following may happen:\r\n\n•\tWe may not be able to provide our products or services to you, either to the same standard or at all\r\n\n•\tWe may not be able to provide you with information about services that you may want, including information about special promotions\r\n\n•\tWe may be unable to tailor the content of our website to your preferences and your experience of our website may not be as enjoyable or useful\r\n\n6. OUR WEBSITE\r\n\nSITE USER TRACKING EXPERIENCE\r\n\nWe may use tracking software to review and improve your experience of our Site.

This enables us to recognise your computer and greet you each time you visit our website without bothering you with a request to register.  It also enables us to keep track of services you view so that, if you consent, we can send you news about those services. We also use cookies to measure traffic patterns, to determine which areas of our website have been visited and to measure transaction patterns in the aggregate.  We use this to research our users’ habits so that we can improve our online services. Our cookies do not collect personal information. You can set your browser to notify you when a cookie has been sent. This allows you to decide whether or not to accept or reject the cookie (although rejecting a cookie may affect your use of a website).

If you do not wish to receive cookies, you can set your browser so that your computer does not accept them. We may log IP addresses (that is, the electronic addresses of computers connected to the Internet) to analyse trends, administer the website, track users’ movements, and gather broad demographic information.\r\n\nSECURITY\r\n\nAs our website is linked to the Internet, and the Internet is inherently insecure, we cannot provide any assurance regarding the security of transmission of information you communicate to us online.  We also cannot guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted over the Internet. Accordingly, any personal information or other information which you transmit to us online is transmitted at your own risk.\r\n\nLINKS\r\n\nWe provide links to websites outside of our website, as well as to third-party websites. These linked sites are not under our control, and we cannot accept responsibility for the conduct of companies, businesses, affiliates, advertisers and sponsors, linked to our website. Before disclosing your personal information on any other website, we advise you to examine the terms and conditions of using that websites and its privacy policy. Third party websites are responsible for informing you about their own privacy practices.\r\n\n7. WHO DO WE DISCLOSE YOUR INFORMATION TO?\r\n\nWe may disclose your personal information to:\r\n\n•\tOur employees, contractors or service providers for the purposes of operating our website or our business, fulfilling requests by you, and to otherwise provide services to you including, without limitation, web hosting providers, IT systems administrators, mailing houses, couriers, payment processors, data entry service providers, electronic network administrators, debt collectors, and professional advisors such as accountants, solicitors, business advisors and consultants\r\n\n•\tSuppliers and other third parties with whom we have commercial relationships, for business, marketing, and related purposes\r\n\n•\tCredit reporting agencies and courts, tribunals, regulatory authorities where customers fail to pay for goods or services provided by us to them, and other law enforcement officers as required by Law; and\r\n\n•\tAny other organisation for any authorised purpose with your express consent.\r\n\nWe only disclose this information if the third party has agreed to comply with the standards in our Privacy Policy. If there is a change of control of our business or a sale or transfer of business assets, we reserve the right to transfer to the extent permissible at law our user databases, together with any personal information and non-personal information contained in those databases. This information may be disclosed to a potential purchaser. We would seek to only disclose information in good faith and where we have sought to maintain confidentiality.\r\n\n8. DIRECT MARKETING MATERIALS\r\n\nWe may send you direct marketing communications and information about our services that we consider may be of interest to you.  These communications may be sent in various forms, including mail, SMS and email, in accordance with applicable marketing laws, such as the Spam Act 2003 (Cth).  If you indicate a preference for a method of communication, we will endeavour to use that method whenever practical to do so.  In addition, at any time you may opt-out of receiving marketing communications from us by contacting us (see the details below) or by using opt-out facilities provided in the marketing communications and we will then ensure that your name is removed from our subscription/mailing list. We do not provide your personal information to other organisations for the purposes of direct marketing. There may be times when the law requires us to provide certain product information to you (for example, product safety notices). We will continue to send you this information even though you have told us you do not wish to receive other types of information about our products.\r\n\n9. SECURITY AND DATA QUALITY\r\n\nWe take reasonable steps to ensure your personal information is protected from misuse and loss and from unauthorised access, modification or disclosure. We strive to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of personal information that you submit to us through our website. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be totally secure. We endeavour to take all reasonable steps to protect the personal information you may transmit to us or from our online products and services. Once we do receive your transmission, we will also make our best efforts to ensure its security on our systems. In addition, our employees and the contractors who provide services related to our information systems are obliged to respect the confidentiality of any personal information held by us. We may hold your information in either electronic or hard copy form.  Personal information is destroyed or de-identified when no longer needed or when we are no longer required by Law to retain it (whichever is the latter).\r\n\n10. HOW LONG DO YOU RETAIN MY PERSONAL DATA FOR?\r\n\nWe will only keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes we collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements. By Law we have to keep basic information about our customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for five years for Australian tax law purposes. In some circumstances you can ask us to delete your data; see your legal rights below for further information. In some circumstances, we may anonymise your personal data (so that it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in which case we may use this information indefinitely without further notice to you.\r\n\n11. HOW CAN YOU ACCESS AND CORRECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?\r\n\nTo effectively conduct our business with you, it is important that the personal information we hold about you is complete, accurate and current. At any time while we hold your personal information, we may ask you to tell us of any changes to your personal information. You may request access to any personal information we hold about you at any time by contacting us (see the details below).  Where we hold information that you are entitled to access, we will try to provide you with suitable means of accessing it (for example, by mailing or emailing it to you).  We may charge you a reasonable fee to cover our administrative and other reasonable costs in providing the information to you. We will not charge for simply making the request and will not charge for making any corrections to your personal information. There may be instances where we cannot grant you access to the personal information we hold.  For example, we may need to refuse access if granting access would interfere with the privacy of others (such as our contractors) or if it would result in a breach of confidentiality.  If that happens, we will give you written reasons for any refusal. If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it.  We will consider if the information requires correction. If we do not agree that there are grounds for correction, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you disagree with it.\r\n\n12.
