  ###### BOARDING INFO


  \- **Boarding is 10 mins prior** to your scheduled departure time. If you arrive earlier than this we ask that you please meet your group at the top, main boardwalk and wait there until your scheduled boarding time. The Marinas are very narrow, so it can be unsafe for large groups to congregate near the boats. At your scheduled boarding time 10 mins prior to departure, please make your way  to the vessel where our crew will be waiting for you. 


  ###### WHAT TO BRING


  \- Filtered water is available on board the vessels.  We suggest bringing a reusable water bottle.  


  \- We welcome any attire on board the vessels so please dress however you feel comfortable to suit the theme of your charter, whether than be a T-Shirt and shorts or cocktail attire.  On winter evenings a jacket is advisable. 


  \- No shoes, no worries!  We offer a relaxed, barefoot sailing experience for your safety and comfort on board.     **You will be asked to slip your shoes off prior to boarding and leave your worries at the dock.**   


  \- If you are sailing during the day and are planning to go for a swim or enjoy our complimentary beach activities, be sure to remember your beach towel, swimmers and sunscreen (slip, slop, slap!) 


  \- A friendly reminder that there is **no smoking** permitted onboard our vessels. Our crew can organise a smoking stop for any guests on request, please let them know at the start of your charter. 


  \-﻿ Please no drinking or noisy behaviour in the marina area as this violates the terms of our lease.  


  If you still have any unanswered questions or are unsure of something, please feel free to give us a call on 0438 915 222 or drop us an email at info@sailinginparadise.com.au.  


  We can't wait to welcome you on board.   


  See you soon!  :-)
