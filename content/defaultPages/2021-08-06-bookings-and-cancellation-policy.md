  **Bookings** 

  We require a 50% deposit to secure your booking. The balance is due at least thirty (30) days prior to the event. By paying the deposit you agree to the terms and conditions set out below. 


  Guests must be 18+ to book and reserve a charter. A legal guardian/parent is required to confirm and pay for a charter booked on behalf of any underage guests. 


  Please be prepared to show your ID and credit card used to make your booking upon boarding if requested by the crew. 


  **Cancellations**

  Refund Policy: Your booking is accepted in good faith.  As soon as we receive your deposit this date and time will be reserved exclusively for you and we will start to decline any other booking requests.


  If you wish to cancel the booking please note the following penalties apply; 


  Up to 91 days - 10% of charter cost is retained to cover administration fees.  The remainder of your deposit will be refunded.


  45-90 days – 25% of charter cost is retained.  Should you wish to reschedule we will apply 12.5% of charter cost towards your next charter.  (we will retain 12.5% of the charter cost to cover administration fees and part lost revenue).


  30-44 days – 50% of charter cost (ie your deposit) is retained.  Should you wish to reschedule we will apply 25% of charter cost towards your next charter.  (we will retain 25% of the charter cost to cover administration fees and part lost revenue).


  15-29 days – 75% of charter cost is retained.  Should you wish to reschedule we will apply 25% of charter cost towards your next charter.  (we will retain 50% of the charter cost to cover administration fees and part lost revenue).


  14-0 days – 100% of charter cost is retained. 


  Please note we do not aim to profit from cancellations, therefore in the instance that the original charter spot is resold we will refund the full payment less 10% administration fee. 


  **Covid Policy**

  Sailing in Paradise abides by government restrictions.   As a small family business our guest’s happiness is our top priority, if you are unable to attend due to the following circumstances, we are able to offer the following terms in addition to the standard cancellation terms.


  **Total Government Shutdown in Gold Coast region** - In the event of a total government shutdown in our region (preventing our operation) we will offer free and unrestricted reschedules for a period of 18 months or an agreed % refund/credit arrangement.


  **Border Closures/COVID Sickness** - In the event of a lead charter guest being unable to reach the boat due to border closures, vaccine restrictions or sickness (while Sailing in Paradise remains operational) we will offer a restricted credit for the full value of your charter, valid for use within 12 months.  The restricted credit can be used to rebook a future charter a maximum of 14 days in advance of the new charter date.     


  In the instance that we are able to resell the original charter spot this 14 day restriction can be removed and a refund will also be possible if preferred.


  We encourage guests who are impacted by border closures, sickness, vaccine concerns or regional lockdowns to please keep in contact as the earlier we are aware of a possible cancellation, the more likelihood we will resell.


  Guests booking rescheduled charters will be charged relevant charter fee on the new booking date (which may be more or less than the original charter).  Rates vary seasonally and by day of the week and this may result in an additional charge or balance credit which can be used towards an extended charter, vessel upgrade or additional charter. Refunds will not be provided for restricted credits.


  Guests should bear in mind possible government restrictions on group numbers, social distancing and vaccine requirements when selecting and booking a vessel as these will need to be adhered to and are the responsibility of the guest.    


  **Wet weather policy:**

  Sailing in Paradise offers a generous wet weather policy however it is very possible to have a good time on board our vessels in the rain.  We have looked after many guests who sailed on rainy days only to state that it actually made it even more fun!    The golden rule…bring your own sunshine…a positive approach and outlook is all that is needed to have a good time in any weather.   Though we do enjoy 300 days of sunshine on the Gold Coast ha ha…


  Please be advised that we make the weather determination on the day of the charter using local observations and Radar images. We do not use weather forecasts (t.v weather reports, BOM etc) as these are seldom accurate and not localised to our particular area of operation.   In some weather conditions it can be difficult to predict the rainfall over a specific 3 hour period so please be prepared to come to the marina (and perhaps have a plan B in the area) as we may be unable to predict in advance.


  We reserve the right to delay the departure time for up to 2 hour to allow the rain to pass (3 hours for full day bookings). In this case we will either extend the charter or if this is not possible due to conflicting bookings, refund the equivalent portion of the charter cost. 


  If it looks like raining heavily for the entire duration of the charter and you do not wish to sail (we urge you to reconsider see above) we will offer the opportunity to reschedule or will refund your charter payment in full as whilst there is ample cover on the boat we do want you to enjoy your experience.


  If it is just overcast or cloudy, or there may be a passing rain event, we would still expect the trip to go ahead as planned as we have reserved the day for your and more than likely refused other bookings.    You can also still have a great time in the rain, especially in summer!


  **Alcohol, Health and Guest Behaviour** 

  Whilst we do want everyone to have a great time on board the vessel, due to our RSA obligations and to ensure the safety of patrons, Sailing In Paradise has some strict rules which must be adhered to at all times.    It is the responsibility of the lead charter guest to ensure all other guests are made aware of these requirements.


  •	Customers are to arrive to and leave the vessel in an orderly fashion with respect to neighbouring businesses, communities and the general public. 


  •	All persons must obey any instructions given by the Master of the vessel or any staff member.

  •	Open bottles of alcohol are not to be taken off the vessel.
