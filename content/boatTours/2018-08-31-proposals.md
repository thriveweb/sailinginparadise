contentColumnTitle: A proposal to remember...
contentColumn: "A yacht proposal is an experience that neither one of you will ever forget.  Our beautiful waterways are the perfect backdrop for romance.  We invite you to sail away on your own private yacht, relaxing on the trampoline style foredeck, sipping champagne and nibbling on gourmet cheese platters to the sounds of your favourite tunes and the waves lapping beneath.   You may even be joined by the friendly bottle-nose dolphins who frequently ride the bow waves of our catamarans.  \n\n> \"Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but the moments that take our breath away\"\n\nThere are many ways to pop the question on board.  Perhaps consider a traditional bended knee approach, arriving at a romantic beach picnic by boat, or our most popular option – revealing our gorgeous ‘Will You Marry Me’ Sail at sunset (the sail can be hoisted discretely by our onboard crew at just the right time.  \r\n\nWe would love to chat with you via phone or email any time and start planning your perfect proposal which can be fully customised to your wishes."

        A unique customised experience - this is not a cookie cutter marriage
        proposal.  You are invited to make this time your own and it should be
        as unique as your relationship.   


        Upon boarding the boat you will be greeted by our friendly crew who will
        adapt to your preference of involvement on board.    We invite you to
        take a walk around the boat and find a place to chill out with a drink
        and enjoy the beautiful views and the sounds of the water.   When it
        comes time to pop the question should you wish to use our beautiful
        'will you marry me' sail simply give our skipper the nod and we will
        unfurl it at the perfect moment often to the sounds of a favourite song
        you may have let us know about.
