  Sailing in Paradise is proud to be supporting Childhood Cancer Support this 'Talk like a Pirate Day' on Monday 19th September 2022.  We will be donating 100% of ticket sales from a special 3 hour Island Cruise departing Main Beach, Gold Coast.    So gather your family and friends and jump aboard as we set sail for 3 hours of fun.   Feel free to dress up in pirate theme (our crew will be getting into the spirit) or come along and enjoy the fun on the day however you feel comfortable.   This experience is suitable for all ages.  What a great way to kick off the school holidays and support a worth cause.  


  Cruise includes light snack.  Drinks are available for purchase on board.


  Should you prefer a private charter for your group on talk like a pirate day please contact us directly and we will be able to help with a private charity cruise.

contentColumn: >-
  Visit an isolated island beach only accessible by boat where you are invited
  to jump in for a swim and try our beach games (including Beach Volleyball,
  Stand Up Paddle-boarding, Beach Cricket and Inflatables).   Or if you just
  want to laze on the beach (or our trampoline-style foredeck) that's totally
  fine, we'll play some cool tunes and serve up an icy cold drink from our
  on-board bar so you can relax and watch the world sail by in style.     But
  don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for the friendly bottlenose dolphins who
  regularly cruise past.


  Take in the sights including impressive superyachts, Sea World, Palazzo Versace, South Stradbroke Island, Wavebreak Island and the Gold Coast Seaway. 


  This is a laid-back cruise experience on a spacious sailing catamaran that you are sure to love.   With no more than 30 guests on board we curate a social atmosphere and we can't wait to welcome you on board our beautiful boat!
