        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at Marina Mirage. Please see the '[contact us](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/)' page on our website for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is parking available at Mariners Cove (paid) and Marina Mirage plus limited street parking on Seaworld Drive.  Please check signage at time of parking and consider ride share for a stress free arrival at your charter (especially during busy times of year).  


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) is often via Maxi Taxis. We can also assist in organising bus transfers for larger groups.  


        **I would like the event to be catered for me?**


        Yes, we work with a range of amazing caterers to offer a wide variety of options for your guests to enjoy on board.  We are fully licensed so can also offer a drinks service for your convenience.   A catering and drinks list will be provided when you make an enquiry.   We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.


        **Where can we go on our charter?**


        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper is knowledgeable in the local area and will make recommendations based on the conditions on the day.  If you don't wish to swim in a 3 hour charter you instead opt to sail further north along the inside of South Stradbroke Island and see the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.


        In the evening we will generally sail north to watch the sunset and return to the southern part of the Broadwater to enjoy the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.


        **Will I get seasick?**


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team.


        **Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?**


        We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility. However we do realise that each individual is different in terms of ability and what they are comfortable with. Please take a look at the 360 tours on the '[Our Boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)' page for an ideal of getting around the boats and do bear in mind a big step up (or carry) is required to board the boats at the marina. Our friendly team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and your guests are comfortable prior to making a booking.
