  title: The perfect family day out!
contentColumnTitle: Bring the family together!
contentColumn: >-
  Our luxury catamarans are so family friendly.  The wide and spacious deck
  areas makes them ideal for everyone to get around and enjoy some fresh ocean
  air.   We like to encourage our guests (big or small) to have fun and
  participate in hoisting the sails and manning the helm (if they are keen)!


  Keep your eyes peeled throughout the cruise as you very well may spot some of the local wildlife on the picturesque Broadwater. Friendly and playful dolphins, soaring sea-eagles and wallabies on the shoreline are often to be seen while underway.   We can arrange rods and bait for you and the kids to have a go at catching a fish if you wish, simply let us know when booking.  


  For daytime cruises, the whole family will enjoy a stop at Wave Break Island, where our vessel's unique beach landing capabilities come into their own!     With a secret ladder on the foredeck it's easy to hop on and off for a swim or some serious sandcastle building!    There’s buckets and spades for the little ones to play and plenty of calm water for everyone to jump in for a swim or wade about in the shallows.   We also have SUPing and inflatable toys for the family to enjoy.   If you’re feeling energetic and want to bring the family together you can have a game of beach volleyball or cricket right there on the island, we have all the gear on board!


  We make chartering a boat easy and tailored to your family’s needs, so we give you the option of choosing where you would like to go and what you would like to do within your chartered time. We can offer adventure and family friendly activities or rest and relaxation, the choice is yours! You can choose to BYO food and drinks or a fully catered charter for easy planning. We supply the eskies, ice, BBQ and BBQ tools free of charge.

        * Skipper plus one crew, (our crew are heaps of fun and have a laid-back yet professional nature) we promise you will love them. Check out the '[about us](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/about-us/)' page to meet the gang!

        * Lots of FUN!!
      title: What's included?
    - dropdownContent: >-
        * Smiles and good vibes :)

        * Swimmers and towel (if you plan to swim)

        * Sunglasses, sunscreen

        * Jacket on cooler days

        * Shoes that you can slip off

        * Food, drinks and non-breakable cups etc (unless you want us to organise the catering for you).
      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.
        Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long
        your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our
        team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim
        stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island
        activities on board. Your skipper is knowledgeable in the local area and
        will make recommendations based on the conditions on the day.  If you
        don't wish to swim in a 3 hour charter you instead opt to sail further
        north along the inside of South Stradbroke Island and see the
        millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.


        In the evening we will generally sail north to watch the sunset and return to the southern part of the Broadwater to enjoy the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.
      title: Where can we go?
    - dropdownContent: >-
        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at Marina Mirage. Please see the '[contact us](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/)' page on our website for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is plentiful free parking at Marina Mirage/Mariners Cove which you are permitted to use.  Please check signage at time of parking and if parking overnight consider street parking to avoid towing.


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) is often via Maxi Taxis.


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.


        **Are your charters suitable for children?**


        Absolutely!   We love having kids on board and our crew will often try and include them in the sailing and driving the boat.  We also carry a range of beach games suitable for kids including buckets and spades for the littlest family members.  The wide and spacious deck area also make the boats wonderful for kids.  Of course as any parent knows, you are always careful with children when it comes to being on the water, but as boats go our catamarans would be some of the most family friendly around.  Please feel free to contact our team if you have any questions about which boat may be best for your family.  


        **Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?**


        We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility.  However we do realise that each individual is different in terms of ability and what they are comfortable with.  Please take a look at the 360 tours on the '[Our Boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)' page for an ideal of getting around the boats and do bear in mind a big step up (or carry) is required to board the boats at the marina.  Our friendly team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and your guests are comfortable prior to making a booking.  


        **Will I get seasick?**


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team.


        **Why should we choose you over another operator?**


        This list is endless. Check out our reviews, check out our socials, speak to someone who has been with us before (you would be surprised, you will probably know someone who has been with us?), and we pride ourselves on the fact that our guests keep coming back (some have sailed with us as many as 8 times). We go out of our way to create the best experience possible and are constantly updating, re-inventing, reinvesting and reviewing. We're not happy until you're happy and we want you to come back again and again. We can blow our own trumpet from time to time right? :-)


        **How do I book?**

Then it is simply a matter of paying your deposit to secure your preferred date. But don't dawdle as we quickly book out and we don't want you to be disappointed.
