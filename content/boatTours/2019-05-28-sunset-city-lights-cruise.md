  ## Gold Coast Sunset Cruise


  Looking for the Gold Coast's best sunset views?   There is no better place to watch the sunset on the Gold Coast than relaxing on a yacht on the Broadwater!   No seriously...


  There is something so magical about a sunset over the water.  But surrounded by it?  Well that's something else...    


  We offer private sunset sails for couples, small family groups, as well as larger groups of up to 42 guests.  


  So come and join us for a sail as the sun sinks behind the mountains of the Gold Coast Hinterland and casts a glow across the calm waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.
