contentColumn: >-
  From 21st birthdays all the way through to 80th's and beyond, we can create a
  memorable and fun birthday party that you and your guests will remember for
  years to come.


  The smooth and stable nature of the catamaran means our boats are suitable for
  all ages and abilities.


  No matter what style of birthday party you wish to create, we can help.
  Whether you are looking for a relaxing day on the water with a BBQ and a few
  beers. A kids birthday party with a beach stopover, sand castles, cakes and
  clowns. Or a boat party with cocktails, inflatable flamingos and awesome tunes
  bring it on!   


  Our guests tell us that spending a day (or evening) on the water was one of
  their best ever Gold Coast birthday party ideas!

   At Sailing In Paradise, we are continually striving to create the best experience possible for our guests.

  We understand that you want your special day to be memorable, fun, relaxing
  and stress free and that is exactly where we come in...


  From the moment you send through an enquiry, all the way through to the follow
  up email with your free souvenir photos after your cruise, we pride ourselves
  on our professional yet friendly and laid-back attitude.

        When you book a private charter with Sailing in Paradise you can expect
        a quality of service from years of experience in the industry but most
        of all your can expect a fun day (or evening) on the water that your
        group will love.  Every day is different when you have your Gold Coast
        birthday party on board Sailing In Paradise but one thing is for sure...
        you're in for one hell of a good time.


        Some things we love include:


        Sailing, beach stopovers, inflatables, stand up paddleboards,
        snorkeling, sunbathing, sunsets and dolphins.   All included free of
        charge*.


        Some things are almost mandatory:


        Singing Happy Birthday to you, cake, embarassing speeches, presents,
        cake, all your favourite songs...did we mention cake?


        \*As much as we have tried to bribe the dolphins to turn up every cruise
        we can't guarantee they will...fish to chase, waves to jump, fun to be
        had etc... but it sure is a beautiful sight when they do join us.
      title: What to expect
    - dropdownContent: |-
        Keep it simple;

        * Swimmers and beach towels.
        * Food and drink (unless you want us to organise the catering for you).
        * Smiles and good vibes.
        * A few decorations or special photos to pop on the table if you wish.

        We'll provide the rest.
      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We love a good birthday but to keep our boats safe and nicely presented
        there are a few things we do not allow on board;


        * Red wine

        * Sparklers 

        * Decorations that stain/leak ink when wet

        * Drunken idiots (tipsy fun peeps totally fine)

        * Budgie Smugglers and mankinis :-)    Well if you are the birthday boy
        and desperately want to wear one we might bend the rules for you just
        once...
      title: Considerations
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We have done a lot of research to find the best Gold Coast party
        caterers and are happy to organise this on your behalf, or you are more
        than welcome to BYO.


        We do have a bbq on board which you are welcome to use however we
        recommend this only if you have booked the boat for 4 hours or more as
        it can take quite a while for you to cook a BBQ and you need to leave
        time for relaxation too right? 


        Grazing style boards and platters are ideal 'boat food'. These can look
        sensational as a centrepiece for the large timber tables we have on
        board and your guests are free to pick away at their convenience.


        We offer Grazing Boards, Tapas , BBQs, Canapes and Private Chefs plus
        many more catering options.  


        We can also assist with a drinks service and offer pre-paid tabs, drinks
        packages or paid bar options.   If you prefer to BYO your drinks this is
        also possible.


        Please enquire and you will receive a list of catering and beverage
        options.
      title: Catered or BYO
    - dropdownContent: >-
        Arrive in style with a stretch Hummer or limousine transfer to the
        marina.


        Add some exciting watersports to your charter. Jetboating and
        Parasailing can be arranged and they can pick you up off the boat for a
        true VIP Experience.

        Q. What happens if it's raining?


        A. Check out our wet weather policy HERE.


        Q. I sometimes get seasick, are there waves?


        A. The boat is very smooth and stable and we operate in the calm
        Broadwater so there are not many waves apart from the odd boat wash. Our
        skilled captains have ways of keeping the boat very smooth so you don't
        spill your drink and you definitely won't get seasick.


        Q. Do I need to bring sunscreen, inflatables, towels, camera, water or
        music?


        A. Most things are provided however you will need to byo towel ad
        camera. One of our friendly staff can let you know what is included when
        you make your initial enquiry.


        Q. How do I book?


        A. Fill out an enquiry form HERE and you will quickly get all the info
        you need including availability, pricing, inclusions etc. Then it is
        simply a matter of paying your deposit to secure your preferred date.
        But don't dawdle as we quickly book out and we don't want you to be
        disappointed.


        Q. Why should we choose you over another operator?


        A. This list is endless. Check out our reviews, check out our socials,
        speak to someone who has been with us before (you would be surprised,
        you will probably know someone who has been with us?), and we pride
        ourselves on the fact that our guests keep coming back (some have sailed
        with us as many as 8 times). We go out of our way to create the best
        experience possible and are constantly updating, re-inventing,
        reinvesting and reviewing. We're not happy until you're happy and we
        want you to come back again and again.  We can blow our own trumpet from
        time to time right?  :-)
