  Choose from our daytime or evening sailing options to experience the Gold
  Coast in a different light.  During the day, our boats are equipped for beach
  landings so you may wish to stop at an Island for swimming or SUP'ing.  As
  dusk falls, the sunset over the Gold Coast hinterland mountains is a delight
  to view from the water, and after dark the Surfers Paradise Skyline puts on a
  stunning light show for our return to Marina Mirage.


  Our beautiful Seawind catamarans offer the relaxation of sailing in complete comfort.   The trampoline-style foredeck is a favourite spot for snuggling and gives an immersive sailing experience with 360 degree views of the Gold Coast’s stunning waterways.  It is also the ideal spot for spying the friendly bottle-nose dolphins who frequently ride the bow waves of our catamarans, so close you can almost touch..

  We would love to chat with you via phone or email any time and start planning your charter which can be fully customised to your wishes.

        you have any questions or special requirements please feel free to reach
        out to our team and we will do our best to accommodate you.   


        Upon boarding the boat you will be greeted by our friendly crew who will adapt to your preference of involvement on board. We invite you to take a walk around the boat and find a place to chill out with a drink and enjoy the beautiful views and the sounds of the water. 


        You can choose to BYO food and drinks on board or ask about our range of catering options.

      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.
        Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long
        your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our
        team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim
        stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island
        activities on board. Your skipper is knowledgeable in the local area and
        will make recommendations based on the conditions on the day.  If you
        don't wish to swim in a 3 hour charter you instead opt to sail further
        north along the inside of South Stradbroke Island and see the
        millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.


        In the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.
      title: Where can we go?
    - dropdownContent: >-
        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at Marina Mirage. Please see the '[contact us](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/)' page on our website for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is parking available at Mariners Cove (paid) and Marina Mirage plus limited street parking on Seaworld Drive.  Please check signage at time of parking and consider ride share for a stress free arrival at your charter (especially during busy times of year).  


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) is often via Taxi or Uber.


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.


        **Will I get seasick?**


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team.


        **Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?**


        We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility. However we do realise that each individual is different in terms of ability and what they are comfortable with. Please take a look at the 360 tours on the '[Our Boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)' page for an ideal of getting around the boats and do bear in mind a big step up (or carry) is required to board the boats at the marina. Our friendly team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and your guests are comfortable prior to making a booking.


        **Why should we choose you over another operator?**


        This list is endless. Check out our reviews, check out our socials, speak to someone who has been with us before (you would be surprised, you will probably know someone who has been with us?), and we pride ourselves on the fact that our guests keep coming back (some have sailed with us as many as 8 times). We go out of our way to create the best experience possible and are constantly updating, re-inventing, reinvesting and reviewing. We're not happy until you're happy and we want you to come back again and again. We can blow our own trumpet from time to time right? :-)


        **How do I book?**


        [Click here](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/booking-enquiry) to fill out an enquiry form and you will quickly get all the info you need including availability, pricing, inclusions etc. You can also book online!
