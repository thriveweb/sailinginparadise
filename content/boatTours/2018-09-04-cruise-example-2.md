  Visit an isolated island beach only accessible by boat where you are invited
  to jump in for a swim and try our beach games (incl Volleyball, Stand Up
  Paddleboarding, Beach Cricket, Snorkels and Inflatables).   Or if you just
  want to chill on the beach (or our trampoline-style foredeck) that's totally
  fine, we'll play some cool tunes and serve up an icy cold drink from our
  on-board bar so you can relax and watch the world sail by in style.     But
  don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for the friendly bottlenose dolphins who
  regularly cruise past.
