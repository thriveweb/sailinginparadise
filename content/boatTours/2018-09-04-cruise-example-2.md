contentColumnTitle: We love our Paradise, let us share it with you!
contentColumn: Visit an isolated island beach only accessible by boat where you
  are invited to jump in for a swim and try our beach games (including Beach
  Volleyball, Stand Up Paddle-boarding, Beach Cricket, Snorkelling and Fun
  Novelty Inflatables).   Or if you just want to laze on the beach (or our
  trampoline-style foredeck) that's totally fine, we'll play some cool tunes
  while you sip on an icy cold drink so you can relax and watch the world sail
  by in style.     But don't forget to keep your eyes peeled for the friendly
  bottlenose dolphins who regularly cruise past.
