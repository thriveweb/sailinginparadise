  ## Last-Minute Charter. Lifelong Memories.


  Thinking about sailing in the next two weeks?\

  This might be your sign.


  Every now and then, our sailing catamarans open up at **special last-minute rates**, perfectly aligned with our existing charter schedule. It’s an invitation to stop postponing joy and say *yes* to the ocean, the sunshine, and a day that reminds you what living well feels like.


  You’ll step aboard one of **Sailing in Paradise’s beautiful sailing catamarans**, personally selected by our team to suit your group. Whether you’re gathering your favourite people or celebrating something special (or nothing at all), this is your chance to turn a free day into an unforgettable one.


  We offer last-minute bookings for groups of **up to 20, 30 or 40 guests** - because some of the best plans are the ones you make on a whim.
