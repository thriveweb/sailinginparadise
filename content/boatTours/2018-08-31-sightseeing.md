  The beauty of a private charter is that the boat is yours to use as you wish
  and you call the shots…  So if you fancy dropping anchor or pulling up on a
  secluded beach for a swim we can make it happen, if you would prefer to spend
  more time sailing that’s also fine. 


  You can choose from our delicious catering menu and drinks packages, or you are welcome to BYO food and drinks. We supply the eskies, ice, BBQ and BBQ tools free of charge. You can even take your pick of music on our private charters as we have Premium Spotify on board. You might want to show off your dance moves or create a relaxing atmosphere and chill to some laid-back tunes. 


  We strive to create the best experience possible for our guests! We don’t just take you for a generic sightseeing cruise, we like to make it a unique experience that you and your guests will remember for years to come.

        We can take you and your guests for a sail past the Marinas where you
        will marvel at the luxurious super yachts and watch the Gold Coast city
        skyline drift into the distance as you sail north.     Wave Break Island
        is a little slice of paradise here on the Gold Coast and a must see,
        especially if you’re in holiday mode!    Our boats are equipped to pull
        up right on the beach, so you can hop on and off as you please. Take
        advantage of our range of beach activities, use the SUP’s or relax on
        our floating splash mat.. If you’re feeling energetic and want to bring
        your group together you can have a game of volleyball or cricket right
        there on the sand! 


        You’re going to see lots of interesting things while out on the Broadwater with us, so be sure to keep an eye out for friendly bottle-nose dolphins, stingrays, turtles and soaring sea-eagles!   You can touch up your tan while lounging out on the foredeck as we sail up to Sovereign Islands to see the mansions of the rich and famous (free sunscreen is available and recommended).


        Fancy trying your hand at sailing?   No problem, let our friendly crew know and they will have you hoisting the sails and manning the helm in no time.   Just want to chill and enjoy a few drinks and  maybe take a quick swim, this is totally fine too.  We also carry a range of fun activities on board the boat for your use.  


        Our cruises are fun and suitable for all ages.

      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at Marina Mirage. Please see the '[contact us](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/)' page on our website[](https://www.sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/) for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is parking available at Mariners Cove (paid) and Marina Mirage plus limited street parking on Seaworld Drive.  Please check signage at time of parking and consider ride share for a stress free arrival at your charter (especially during busy times of year).  


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) is often via Maxi Taxis. 


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**


        Yes, on a private charter if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to canapes and private chefs.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.


        **Will I get seasick?**


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team.


        **Are your charters suitable for children?**


        Absolutely! We love having kids on board and our crew will often try and include them in the sailing and driving the boat. We also carry a range of beach games suitable for kids including buckets and spades for the littlest family members. The wide and spacious deck area also make the boats wonderful for kids. Of course as any parent knows, you are always careful with children when it comes to being on the water, but as boats go our catamarans would be some of the most family friendly around. We do ask that there is a responsible, sober adult onboard to keep an eye on the kiddies. Please feel free to contact our team if you have any questions about which boat may be best for your family.


        **Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?**


        We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility. However we do realise that each individual is different in terms of ability and what they are comfortable with. Please take a look at the 360 tours on the '[Our Boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)' page for an ideal of getting around the boats and do bear in mind a big step up (or carry) is required to board the boats at the marina. Our friendly team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and your guests are comfortable prior to making a booking.


        **Why should we choose you over another operator?**


        This list is endless. Check out our reviews, check out our socials, speak to someone who has been with us before (you would be surprised, you will probably know someone who has been with us?), and we pride ourselves on the fact that our guests keep coming back (some have sailed with us as many as 8 times). We go out of our way to create the best experience possible and are constantly updating, re-inventing, reinvesting and reviewing. We're not happy until you're happy and we want you to come back again and again. We can blow our own trumpet from time to time right? :-)


        **How do I book?**
