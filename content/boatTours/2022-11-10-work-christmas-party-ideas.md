  ## The ultimate work Christmas Party Idea for 2023


  Looking for ideas to host this year’s work Christmas Party?  How does a Boat Cruise aboard your own private catamaran sound?    We challenge you to find another office Christmas Party venue with views to match where you can BYO, play your own tunes and float around, cocktail in hand..


  Sounds awesome right?   


  ###### Got your own Christmas Party ideas?


  Tell us what floats your boat and we'll do our best to make it happen.  Some options include;


  * A relaxed sunset cruise with canapes and champagne,

  * A day on the water with swimming, Island activities, and delicious BBQ lunch and icy cold beers,

  * or even a high octane team building day with sailing challenges and water sports?


  These are just a few of the Office Christmas Party ideas available with Sailing in Paradise.   The options are endless and our friendly team are on hand to help you plan 'your Christmas Party your way'.  


  We have looked after all sorts of industry clients from fitness studios and uber-cool restaurants to banks and legal firms (and everything in between).   There is something about spending time on the water that brings people (of all ages and backgrounds) together and we would love to put on a Christmas Party your whole team will talk about for years to come!

        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at Marina Mirage. Please see the 'contact us' page on our website for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is parking available at Mariners Cove (paid) and Marina Mirage plus limited street parking on Seaworld Drive.  Please check signage at time of parking and consider ride share for a stress free arrival at your charter (especially during busy times of year).  


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis. We can also help to arrange bus transfers for larger groups.  


        **Can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.


        **Can I BYO food and drink?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.


        **Where can we go on our charter?**


        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper can make recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.


        In the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.


        **Will I get seasick?**


        Nope. We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time on our boats especially in the warm Gold Coast endless summer... But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team.
