      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        So you've decided you want a boat party...now time to plan it!   


        You can take whatever approach you wish towards planning your party and we've got your back.  We understand that life gets busy (especially when there is a wedding to plan) so if you would like us to take care of things like catering, drinks and cheeky butlers (so you can just turn up and enjoy), then we will take the helm and organise everything on your behalf!  


        Alternatively, if you have heaps of ideas of your own and want to customise or theme your party let us know what you've got planned and we are happy to give advice and ideas on how it may work.  


        Here are a few extra hen's party ideas;


        **Pick a theme**


        We love a themed hen's party!   Some popular options are white parties (a total classic and always looks so chic) and tropical (just perfect for a boat/island party).


        If you are looking at our BYO option why not carry the theme into your food and drink.  We also welcome themed decorations (there are a few guidelines around this so please do check in with us first).    Generally we recommend the table is a great place to start with theming since these are centrally located on all our boats and provide a nice focal point.  


        **Plan some hen's party games (if your hen is into this)**


        We have seen it all...trust us and what happens on the boat stays on the boat he he...  Here are a few of the hen's party games our guests have enjoyed in the past;


        * Bride and Groom trivia games

        * Pin the pants on the cardboard cut out of the groom

        * Toilet paper wedding dress creation contests

        * Tug of war on the beach

        * Bridal Bingo

        * Hen's Party Dares

        * Plus some very cheeky games the girls have dreamed up involving our cheeky butlers ha ha

      title: Cheeky butlers...

        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at Marina Mirage. Please see the '[contact us](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/)' page on our website[](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/) for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is parking available at Mariners Cove (paid) and Marina Mirage plus limited street parking on Seaworld Drive.  Please check signage at time of parking and consider ride share for a stress free arrival at your charter (especially during busy times of year).  


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) is often via Maxi Taxis. 


        **Can I BYO?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.  


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.


        **Where can we go on our charter?**


        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater, our departure point of Marina Mirage allows us to go further on your charter and enjoy the islands etc.


        Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper is knowledgeable in the local area and will make recommendations based on the conditions on the day.  If you don't wish to swim in a 3 hour charter you instead opt to sail further north along the inside of South Stradbroke Island and see the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.


        In the evening we will generally sail north to watch the sunset and return to the southern part of the Broadwater to enjoy the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.


        **Will I get seasick?**  


        Nope.   We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick or spill your drink either :-).  


        **What happens if it rains?**


        A little rain doesn't stop a great party on our boats.    All vessels have a large undercover area and we will continue to sail in most conditions.  


        But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy, so if there is torrential rain/strong winds etc you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise.  Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team. 


        **Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?**


        We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility. However we do realise that each individual is different in terms of ability and what they are comfortable with. Please take a look at the 360 tours on the '[Our Boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)' page for an ideal of getting around the boats and do bear in mind a big step up (or carry) is required to board the boats at the marina. Our friendly team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and your guests are comfortable prior to making a booking.


        **How do I book?**


        [Click here](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/booking-enquiry) to fill out an enquiry form and you will quickly get all the info you need including availability, pricing, inclusions etc. You can also book online! Then it is simply a matter of paying your deposit to secure your preferred date. But don't dawdle as we quickly book out and we don't want you to be disappointed.
