  ## gold coast Hens party boat


  Hen's Parties are totally our thing!  We love them and, well,...they love
  us... (blush).   Its a mutual admiration kind of situation and we love nothing
  more than making our lovely hens happy on their special day!       


  Any style, any vibe the choice is yours, we don't bring pre-prescribed ideas
  of what a hens party should be.  We simply bring beautiful, spacious (and
  totally photogenic) boats with a super-fun, professional crew to help you host
  the hen's party of your dreams.

contentColumn: >-
  We have hosted thousands of happy Hens parties but no two have ever been
  alike.   So what will you party be?  A relaxed afternoon on the water with
  swimming and sunbaking, an elegant morning tea with mimosas or a wild hen's
  night party with all the hen's party trimmings?  The choice is totally yours
  and we are here to help with whatever you wish.    


  We are continually striving to create the best experience possible for our
  guests.  We understand that you want your special day to be memorable, fun,
  relaxing and stress free and that is exactly where we come in.


  From the moment you send through an enquiry all the way through to the follow
  up email with your free souvenir photos after your cruise, we pride ourselves
  on our professional yet friendly and laid back attitude.


  ## the perfect hen's party boats


  With 2 beautiful sailing catamarans available for charter we can accommodate
  groups of up to 20 or 30 guests.    [Click here for a tour of our boats.

  The large trampoline-style fore-decks are perfect for lazing in the sunshine
  or dancing, while we sail the calm, clear waters of the Gold Coast. The ample
  undercover space makes the vessels perfect for those seeking shade. Facilities
  are plentiful to ensure you have everything on hand to enjoy a perfect day!

  ## All the hens party extras


  We have a great range of novelty floating inflatables available. Kick back on
  one of our supersized flamingos or swans, laze on a giant slice of watermelon
  or pull up a pineapple.


  We also offer a range of free activities including stand up paddleboards,
  beach cricket, snorkelling, beach volleyball or frisbees.


  Be sure to dress for the occasion, as we always take photos on the day to
  capture all those precious moments so you can take lots of great memories
  home.  Practically all of the photos you will see on our Instagam page are
  taken by our crew on board actual charters.  


  We are confident that a Gold Coast hen’s party with Sailing In Paradise, is an
  experience your group will be talking about for years to come!

      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        So you've decided you want a boat party...now time to plan it!   


        You can take whatever approach you wish towards planning your party and
        we've got your back.  We understand that life gets busy (especially when
        there is a wedding to plan) so if you would like us to take care of
        things like catering, drinks and cheeky butlers (so you can just turn up
        and enjoy), then we will take the helm and organise everything on your
        behalf!  


        Alternatively, if you have heaps of ideas of your own and want to
        customise or theme your party let us know what you've got planned and we
        are happy to give advice and ideas on how it may work.  


        Here are a few extra hen's party ideas;


        **Pick a theme**


        We love a themed hen's party!   Some of our faves have included nautical
        (think sailors hats, stripes), mermaids (Tails 'n all), white parties (a
        total classic and always looks so chic) and tropical (just perfect for a
        boat/island party)


        If you are looking at our BYO option why not carry the theme into your
        food and drink.  We also welcome themed decorations (there are a few
        guidelines around this so please do check in with us first).   
        Generally we recommend the table is a great place to start with theming
        since these are centrally located on both boats and provide a nice focal
        point.  


        **Plan some hen's party games**


        We have seen it all...trust us and what happens on the boat stays on the
        boat he he...  Here are a few of the hen's party games our guests have
        enjoyed in the past;


        * Bride and Groom trivia games

        * Pin the pants on the cardboard cut out of the groom 

        * Toilet paper wedding dress creation contests

        * Tug of war on the beach

        * Bridal Bingo

        * Hen's Party Dares

        * Plus some very cheeky games the girls have dreamed up involving our
        cheeky butlers ha ha


        **Talking of cheeky butlers...**


        If you are looking for the perfect ice breaker, guaranteed to make the
        bride smile and her nan giggle we can't recommend these guys enough.  
        Wearing just an apron, bow tie and a smile, our butlers are the best in
        the business.  With a personality guaranteed to get the party started
        your personal butler will serve drinks, play games and keep your guests
        entertained all while making the perfect hen's party eye candy.   


        For even more great ideas and inspiration be sure to follow our
        instagram page @sailinginparadisegoldcoast or our facebook page
        @sailinginparadise via the links at the base of the site.
      title: Hen's Party Ideas
    - dropdownContent: "**Where do your boats depart from?**\r\n\nOur boats are berthed at D9 and D10 at Marina Mirage. Please see the 'contact us' page on our website\r www.sailinginparadise.com.au for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins\r from Broadbeach.\r\n\n**Where can I park?**\r\n\nThere is plentiful free parking underneath the Marina Mirage Shopping Centre which you are permitted to use.\r\n\n**What about other transport options?**\r\n\nThere are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) if often via\r Maxi Taxis. We can also assist in organizing bus, hummer or limo transfers if you are after more of an experience.\n\n**Can I BYO?**\r\n\nYes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.\r\n\n**I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**\r\n\nYes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance\r bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.\r\n\n**Do you have Eskies on board?**\r\n\nYes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.\n\n**Where can we go on our charter?**\r\n\nWe operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you\r would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team.   In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board.   Your skipper can make recommendations on the day, if you don't wish to swim you could also go\r up and sail around the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.   \n\nIn the evening we usually recommend sailing north to watch the sunset and returning to the southern part of the Broadwater to see the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.  \n\n**Will I get seasick?**  \n\nNope.   We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go\r\n\noffshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do\r not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick or spill your drink either :-).  \n\n**What happens if it rains?**\n\nFirst of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great party on our boats ha ha...   But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise.  Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team."
