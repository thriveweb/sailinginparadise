  ## gold coast Hens party boat


  Hen's Parties are totally our thing!  We love them and, well,...they love us... (blush).   Its a mutual admiration kind of situation and we love nothing more than making our lovely hens happy on their special day!       


  Any style, any vibe the choice is yours, we don't bring pre-prescribed ideas of what a hens party should be.  We simply bring beautiful, spacious (and totally photogenic) boats with a super-fun, professional crew to help you host the hen's party of your dreams.

  We are continually striving to create the best experience possible for our guests.  We understand that you want your special day to be memorable, fun, relaxing and stress free and that is exactly where we come in.

  ## the perfect hen's party boats


  With 3 beautiful sailing catamarans available for charter we can accommodate groups of up to 20 or 30 guests.    [Click here for a tour of our boats. ](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)


  The large trampoline-style fore-decks are perfect for lazing in the sunshine or dancing, while we sail the calm, clear waters of the Gold Coast. The ample undercover space makes the vessels perfect for those seeking shade. Facilities are plentiful to ensure you have everything on hand to enjoy a perfect day!

  We also offer a range of free activities including stand up paddleboards, beach cricket, beach volleyball or frisbees.


  Be sure to dress for the occasion, as we always take photos on the day to capture all those precious moments so you can take lots of great memories home.  Practically all of the photos you will see on our Instagam page are taken by our crew on board actual charters.  


  We are confident that a Gold Coast hen’s party with Sailing In Paradise, is an experience your group will be talking about for years to come!

      title: What to Bring
    - dropdownContent: >-
        So you've decided you want a boat party...now time to plan it!   


        You can take whatever approach you wish towards planning your party and we've got your back.  We understand that life gets busy (especially when there is a wedding to plan) so if you would like us to take care of things like catering, drinks and cheeky butlers (so you can just turn up and enjoy), then we will take the helm and organise everything on your behalf!  


        Alternatively, if you have heaps of ideas of your own and want to customise or theme your party let us know what you've got planned and we are happy to give advice and ideas on how it may work.  


        Here are a few extra hen's party ideas;


        **Pick a theme**


        We love a themed hen's party!   Some of our faves have included nautical (think sailors hats, stripes), mermaids (Tails 'n all), white parties (a total classic and always looks so chic) and tropical (just perfect for a boat/island party).


        If you are looking at our BYO option why not carry the theme into your food and drink.  We also welcome themed decorations (there are a few guidelines around this so please do check in with us first).    Generally we recommend the table is a great place to start with theming since these are centrally located on all our boats and provide a nice focal point.  


        **Plan some hen's party games**


        We have seen it all...trust us and what happens on the boat stays on the boat he he...  Here are a few of the hen's party games our guests have enjoyed in the past;


        * Bride and Groom trivia games

        * Pin the pants on the cardboard cut out of the groom

        * Toilet paper wedding dress creation contests

        * Tug of war on the beach

        * Bridal Bingo

        * Hen's Party Dares

        * Plus some very cheeky games the girls have dreamed up involving our cheeky butlers ha ha


        **Talking of cheeky butlers...**


        If you are looking for the perfect ice breaker, guaranteed to make the bride smile and her nan giggle we can't recommend these guys enough.   Wearing just an apron, bow tie and a smile, our butlers are the best in the business.  With a personality guaranteed to get the party started your personal butler will serve drinks, play games and keep your guests entertained all while making the perfect hen's party eye candy.   


        For even more great ideas and inspiration be sure to follow our instagram page @sailinginparadisegoldcoast or our facebook page @sailinginparadise via the links at the base of the site.

        **Where do your boats depart from?**


        Our boats are berthed at Marina Mirage. Please see the 'contact us' page on our website[](www.sailinginparadise.com.au/contact-us/) for further details and a map. Marina Mirage is about 10 mins from Surfers and 15 mins from Broadbeach.


        **Where can I park?**


        There is plentiful free parking at Marina Mirage/Mariners Cove which you are permitted to use.  Please check signage at time of parking and if parking overnight consider street parking to avoid towing.


        **What about other transport options?**


        There are lots of ways to get to the boat! The most popular (and cost effective/convenient) if often via Maxi Taxis. 


        **Can I BYO?**


        Yes if you would like to bring your own food and drinks on board that is completely fine.  


        (BYO food and drinks may be affected by Government restrictions due to Covid, please check at the time of your charter what the current restrictions are.)


        **I am short on time can you please help me out with catering/drinks?**


        Yes, we also offer catering and drinks service for your convenience. Please request our full catering list as advance bookings are required. We offer a range of catering options from grazing boards, to tapas and private chefs.


        (Catering and drinks service options may be affected by Government restrictions due to Covid, please check at the time of your charter what the current restrictions are.)


        **Do you have Eskies on board?**


        Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large and can be used for food or drink.


        **Where can we go on our charter?**


        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long your boat charter is for so please feel free to discuss this with our team. In a 3 hour charter during the day our guests usually love a swim stop at Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities on board. Your skipper is knowledgeable in the local area and will make recommendations based on the conditions on the day.  If you don't wish to swim in a 3 hour charter you instead opt to sail further north along the inside of South Stradbroke Island and see the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Islands.


        In the evening we will generally sail north to watch the sunset and return to the southern part of the Broadwater to enjoy the city lights after dark which are just beautiful.


        **Will I get seasick?**  


        Nope.   We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do not experience large waves. Our catamarans are very stable, and do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by single hull vessels so you won't get seasick or spill your drink either :-).  


        **What happens if it rains?**


        First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great party on our boats ha ha...   But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to cancel or reschedule your cruise.  Please see the full booking policy provided with your invoice for full details or contact our team.


        **Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?**


        We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility. However we do realise that each individual is different in terms of ability and what they are comfortable with. Please take a look at the 360 tours on the 'Our Boats' page for an ideal of getting around the boats and do bear in mind a big step up (or carry) is required to board the boats at the marina. Our friendly team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and your guests are comfortable prior to making a booking.
