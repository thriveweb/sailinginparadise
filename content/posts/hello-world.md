Ask any Gold Coast local about their favourite places on the GC and Burleigh Heads (or simply Burleigh as it’s known to the locals) is sure to factor in pretty high on the list.   And it’s not hard to see why.  Burleigh’s heady mix of cool boutiques, hipster dining, golden beaches, surf breaks and awesome walks have long endeared Burleigh with the local crowd and are frequented by the Gold Coast’s beautiful people.

So whether you are heading to Burleigh for a day or evening there is plenty to keep you entertained.

Some of our favourite things to do in the Burleigh Area include;

**Explore the Burleigh Headland.**

The Burleigh Headland national park is truly a Gold Coast treasure.  

Visit the Jellurgal Aboriginal Cultural Centre and embark on a guided interpretive tour of the headland   whilst learning the cultural history of the Gold Coast. 

Or begin your headland walk from the Burleigh surf break side. Completely beautiful and endlessly instaworthy.   Don’t forget your camera, there are so many wonderful photo opportunities including the classic palm-framed shot looking back across the ocean to the Surfers Paradise Skyline.   

Once you have trodden the well-worn path around the headland you will be treated to the always-impressive sight of Tallebudgeera creek.  A great place for a dip in the turquoise waters, this creek is such a beautiful spot and extremely popular with families who enjoy the shallow calm waters.

If you aren’t up for the walk, there are some great spots on Burleigh hill to take a load off, bring along a picnic and enjoy the view.  There is also a great kid’s play ground.

**Surf and Sand**

Renowned worldwide as a pro-surf spot, Burleigh delivers the goods when it comes to its amazing beach.   If you aren’t quite up for the paddle out and just fancy a quick dip, you are sure to find a calm spot most days at Burleigh.

**Shop, Shop, Shop (hint: bring your credit card)**

Once a sleepy seaside suburb, Burleigh has most definitely come of age in recent years.   The plethora of designer fashion and homewares on offer in James Street really speaks for itself in this regard.  It is a great place to head if you are looking for unique finds on the Gold Coast.

We also love the Village Markets, held bi-monthly at the Burleigh Heads State School for amazing vintage and eclectic designer fashion and lifestyle offerings.  Check their website for forthcoming market dates http://www.thevillagemarkets.co/

**Relax with a coffee and watch the world go by,
 or dine in a world class restaurant.**

The café and dining scene in Burleigh will not disappoint, whether you are after a funky café, a special restaurant or something in between.   You’ll find absolute ocean-front dining, roof top dining and laneway bars and cafes aplenty.   A great spot for an Acai Bowl breakfast before taking on the Burleigh Headland walk.

Notable restaurants definitely worth a mention include Rick Shores, The Fish House, Jimmy Wah's, Mr Hizola's, Justin Lane, Harry's Steak Bistro and many more.

There are even a couple of secret night spots for those in the know... just ask a local.

**Getting to Burleigh**

Parking is always at a premium in Burleigh and can be hard to find. Make sure you feed the recently introduced parking meters or you'll quickly find yourself with a $78 parking fine. If at all possible, it is so much easier to catch the bus to this spot!

**Getting to Sailing in Paradise from Burleigh Heads**

Sailing in Paradise departs from Marina Mirage, Main Beach about a 30 minute drive north from Burleigh Heads.   Simply follow the Gold Coast Highway and then turn off before the Sundale Bridge following the signs for Sea World.    Marina Mirage is located on the left and there is ample undercover parking.
