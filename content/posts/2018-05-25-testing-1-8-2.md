## Gold Coast Family Activities.

Trying to coordinate things to do on the Gold Coast can be tough when trying to please a whole family.    We aim to provide a stress-free day that gets the kids active and enjoying the outdoors while the parents enjoy a beautiful day on the water. 

Of course, the most popular activity for the adults is relaxing on the front deck with a drink in hand, watching the world sail by and listening to your favourite tunes.   Activities for the children are also a ‘no-brainer’ as we’ll be more than happy to let your little ones help to hoist the sails and take the helm.     The open-plan layout of the boat means that you can see both the indoor seating area and the trampolines out front at all times, providing peace of mind and enabling you to keep an eye on the kids.   The wide and spacious deck area makes it ideal for kiddies of all ages (even the littlies) to get around.

Our sailing catamaran is purpose built for day cruising and entertaining and is the perfect choice for families to get together for a great day on the water.  With its unique shallow draft and front and rear boarding ladders this boat is unique in it’s ability to pull up straight onto the Gold Coast Broadwater’s beautiful island beaches including Wavebreak Island and South Stradbroke Island. There the kids can stretch their legs and and enjoy the fresh air and great outdoors.

From toddlers, to pre-schoolers all the way up to tweens and teens there is something about being out on the water and close to nature that appeals to all age ranges.    There are plenty of fun and free activities to keep the kids entertained for a few hours or a full day including buckets and spades for building sandcastles, snorkelling gear, beach cricket or volleyball, fishing, frisbees, stand-up paddle boards and fun fruity inflatables.

Whether you opt for a 'private charter' or decide to join one of our ticketed 'Island Sailing Adventure Cruises' you are sure to have an awesome day on the beautiful Gold Coast broadwater.

### Sailing in the Gold Coast Broadwater

Built on a network of keys and rivers, the Gold Coast is known for its amazing weather and outdoor lifestyle. The excitement doesn’t stop at theme parks and great shopping – Experience a day on the water with Sailing in Paradise to find out why so many people find their way to the Gold Coast and stay forever!  We love to hoist the sails and this is truly one of the best experiences to create special memories when visiting the Gold Coast.

Our area of operation is the southern Moreton Bay Marine Park which is home to an abundance of marine and bird life and over 300 islands.

Sailing up the Gold Coast Broadwater affords spectacular views of the Surfers Paradise skyline behind as we explore up towards Paradise Point and inside the protected coast of South Stradbroke Island. As we sail in these protected smooth waters, there’s no need to worry about rough conditions as the water is incredibly calm and both our catamarans, the 'Spirit of Gwonda' and our 1000XL are extremely smooth and stable. The famous beach at Wave Break Island is the perfect spot to break the journey for some sandcastle building competitions, a spot of beach cricket and start up the BBQ for a picnic.

If we’re lucky in the afternoons we’ll often be joined a pod dolphins as they cruise in through the sea way in search of their evening meal.

#### Catering options and Watersports

Sailing in Paradise has sourced the best Gold Coast caterers to provide a range of catering options to suit all budgets. From BYO to fully catered with private chefs and wait staff, we’ve done the rounds to ensure you receive the best catering experience. Both catamarans  are equipped with large eskie’s stocked with ice and there's a marine BBQ if you decide to BYO.

Sailing in Paradise can also arrange packages to include parasailing, jetboating and other watersports to create a truly unbelievable day.
