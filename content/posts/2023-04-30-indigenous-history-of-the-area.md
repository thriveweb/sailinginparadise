Although we all know and love the Gold Coast for its stunning coastline, the great nightlife
and incredible national park areas, there’s a good chance the majority of us are somewhat
unaware of the rich Indigenous history and traditional ownership of the area. As we sail
along the Broadwater, it is impossible not to feel a connection to the ocean so it is only right
that we honour the original custodians of our region who were known as the ‘Saltwater
People.’


The Yugambeh people from the Yugambeh Language Region are the traditional custodians
of the area and there is archaeological evidence indicating that they have lived in the Gold
Coast region for over 20,000 years. Yugambeh refers to people descended from speakers of
a range of dialects spoken in the Albert and Logan River basins of South Queensland,
stretching over the area from the Gold Coast to Beaudesert, while also including the coastal
area just over the border into New South Wales to the Tweed Valley. By the time European
colonisation began, the Yugambeh had a complex network of groups, and kinship. It was
also noted by early visitors that they used a variety of technology in their daily lives,
including canoes.


The Yugambeh region includes families that identify as Kombumerri, Mununjali,
Wangerriburra, Bullongin, Gugingin, Migunberri, Murangburra, Cudgenburra and Tulgigin. A
term for an Aboriginal of the Yugambeh tribe is Mibunn, which is derived from the word for
the Wedge-Tailed Eagle, a beautiful bird we often see soaring above the Broadwater during
our sailing charters.


The different Yugambeh clans had their own allocated area of country and domain over that
area - it was typically where they hunted and lived. Each family group had a number of
permanent camps established and moved from camp to camp in response to seasonal and
environmental changes. Clans would frequently visit each other during times of ceremony,
dispute resolution, resource exchange and debt settlement, but followed strict protocols that
governed these visitations and the use of each other’s land. The clan group boundaries tend
to follow noticeable geological formations such as river basin systems and mountain ranges.
The Kombumerri people were known as the ‘Saltwater People’ and their tribal boundaries
are said to have extended from the Coomera River in the north to Tallebudgera Creek in the
South. The men had identifying marks on their right wrists from netting in the Broadwater
and the women that were married, or were initiated to fish with the men, had their left little
finger severed.


The area around present day Bundall, proximate to the Nerang River and Surfers Paradise,
along with various other locations in the region, was an established meeting place for tribes
visiting from as far away as Grafton and Maryborough. Great corroborees were held there
and traces of Aboriginal camps and intact bora rings are still visible in the Gold Coast and
Tweed River region today, including the bora ring at the Jebribillum Bora Park at Burleigh
Heads. The Yugambeh clans also gathered annually on the coast for the mullet feast.
The Gugingin of the Logan area were noted as expert net makers, using fine cone-shaped
nets to trap fish, and larger nets over 15 metres wide to trap kangaroos. When moving
between camps, groups would leave their excess equipment and other belongings behind in
a small shelter made like a tripod covered with bark; it was a point of honour that belongings
left in this way were never stolen.



The Quandamooka of Stradbroke Island had dolphins aid them in the hunting and fishing
processes and it has been stated that this practice was shared by the Yugambeh
Kombumerri clan. On sighting a shoal of mullet, they would hit the water with their spears to
alert their dolphins, to whom they gave individual names, and the dolphins would then chase
the shoal towards the shore, trapping them in the shallows and allowing the men to net and
spear the fish. Whilst sailing alongside the various sandbanks in the Broadwater, we often
see dolphins performing this technique and are reminded of this rich history and the
importance of our relationship with the natural world.
Dreaming stories speak of Nerang cultural hero, Gowanda, a white-haired man who
provided for his tribe by training dingos to hunt alongside them. Local lore says after he
passed away, he returned as a white dolphin and children spotted him splashing in the
waves at Main Beach. Our original catamaran is named Spirit of Gwonda and pays homage
to this legend.


The Yugambeh people are assigned personal and family totems at birth. Some totems
include: Wajin (platypus), Bin&#39;gin (freshwater turtle), Buneen (echidna), Gumburra
(macadamia nut), Chungarra (pelican), and Borobi (koala.) Totems are considered as family
and the Yugambeh people are committed to looking after them. This respect for totems goes
back over many generations to ensure the sustainability of our environment. Yugambeh
people are connected to jagun (country) and everything on it. The plants and animals, the
mountains and valleys, the rivers and ocean. The language remains in the land, carried by
people and is used today in place and suburb names as seen in the examples below:
Jalubay-ngagam (Tallebudgera Creek: dingo urine)
Nyirang (Nerang: shovelnose shark)
Majeribah (Mudgeeraba: place of sticky mud)
Kooralbyn (copper snake)
Gumbubah (Coombabah: Place of the gumbu cobra worm)
Bimbimbah (Pimpama: Place of soldier bird)
Jambreen (Tamborine Mountain: place of the finger lime and yam in a cliff)


The traditional Yugambeh diet consisted of flora and fauna native to the region and almost
anything that could be eaten was. The native Gulmorhan (fern-root) was a staple and major
source of starch, and other plant roots were also eaten like Bulrush, Native Rosella, and
Cotton Tree. The native fruits of the Blue Quandong, Crab Apple, Blueberry, Native Cherry,
Tuckeroo, and Lilli Pilli were consumed, in addition to the berries of the Barbwire Vine,
Passionfruit and Raspberry. Banksia flowers were swirled in water to make a honey
flavoured drink and the leaves of the David&#39;s Heart were used as serving plates for food.
The most basic way of cooking involved ground heated by a fire which was extinguished and
cleared. Food would be placed on the heated earth until cooked; this was a common way of
cooking shellfish like oysters or mud whelks. A fire was kept burning while larger portions of
food like meat were cooked. Alternatively, the food was sealed inside an earth oven in a pit
while it cooked. This was a suitable way to cook birds, especially emus. Other species
consumed were freshwater mullet, the long-necked turtle, the short-necked turtle, and eel.
The eggs of the Brush Turkey were highly sought and most waterbird species were also
eaten.


Dozens of species of plants were used for medicinal purposes, and local people continue to
use them to this day. The inner bark of Acacia was used for skin disorders, Milky Mangrove
sap was used to treat heat ulcers, Spotted Gum resin was used for toothaches, and insect
bites were treated with the sap of Bungwall or Bracken. Animal by-products, like the fat from
the Lace Monitor, and the leaves of multiple plants were also used in a variety of medicinal

ways. An infusion of Water Chestnut leaves was used as a healing agent, an infusion of
Native Raspberry leaves was a stomach ache treatment, and chewing the leaves of the
Grey Mangrove relieved the pain of marine stingers.
Their closeness to the land has enabled indigenous communities to live sustainably for
thousands of years and these generations of observation and practice have provided us with
an invaluable library of knowledge. Cultural knowledge of weather systems has helped us to
understand Australia’s diverse ecosystems and the cyclical nature of our country’s unique
landscape, which is essential for our future survival.


Whilst on charter with Sailing in Paradise, we invite you to take a moment to remember and
pay your respects to the traditional families of the Yugambeh region, whose history and
stories we need not only to continue telling, but also preserve for many generations to come.


Please note: Aboriginal languages have historically been unwritten, which has resulted in
many different spelling systems being used. These systems may have changed or may
change as communities work to revitalise and document their languages - no system is
‘incorrect’, they each capture the nuances of language in their own way.
