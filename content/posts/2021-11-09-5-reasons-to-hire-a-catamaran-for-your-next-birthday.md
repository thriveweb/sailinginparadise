Another year older means it’s time to celebrate! Whether it’s your 21st birthday, a 30th celebration or perhaps 80th soiree, sailing around in a catamaran in the beautiful sunny Gold Coast makes for a fabulous time and the perfect birthday party venue, that will be remembered for years to come. 

If that doesn’t sell you on the idea, we have 5 reasons why you should book your next birthday party with [Sailing in Paradise](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/booking-enquiry/). 

## It’s Unique 

Are you over celebrating your birthday the same as you did last year and the year before that and the year before that? Well, we totally get it, there is only so many times you can head to the same, bars, pubs, clubs and restaurants. Setting sail on crystal clear waters, stopping at islands and enjoying incredible sunsets, all while on a catamaran, offers a totally new and unique [birthday party venue](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/boat-charter/gold-coast-birthday-parties/) for you to enjoy with your friends and family. `

Our sailing catamarans are smooth and have an open-plan layout, perfect for hosting your next party! We understand everyone likes to celebrate differently and we have options to suit absolutely everyone.

If you’re looking for something relaxed and fun, we offer delicious catering options, drink packages or the option of BYO. Each of our catamarans includes a superb sound system, stainless steel barbeques and large eskies to keep those drinks cold as you sail around on beautiful clear waters!

If you’re looking for something more high end, we offer stunning sunset cruises with canapes, a personal chef and plenty of champagne, the option is truly yours. 

## It’s More Affordable Than You Think 

Hiring a venue, or even a table at certain restaurants can leave quite a dent in your pocket! You may think sailing on a catamaran is way out of your budget, but we assure you it is more affordable than you think. With BYO food and drinks an option, we also have quality caterers to suit every budget. 

We pride ourselves on offering the best value on the Gold Coast for the quality of vessel and service we provide. Our rates vary seasonally and will change depending on the selected vessel and duration. If your birthday is in our off-season, great you can expect your catamaran to be cheaper than our busier times.

“Totally the best day. Great communication from booking through to sailing. Boat amazing, staff fabulous. Highly recommend and will book again in the future for special events.” - Janice Aus. 

“We celebrated our daughter’s sweet sixteen on board with a group of her friends. Staff couldn’t have been nicer, Gemma and Daniel were very friendly and accommodating. Everything was run very professionally and correspondence before and after were great. Would love to sail again with them one day.” - Zoe, Aus

“Seriously the best experience ever!!! From start to finish, you didn’t need to worry about a thing! Staff are incredible and very funny, boat...perfect and the whole experience flowed beautifully! Highly recommend the catering packages too...delish. Now we are all trying to plan whose next birthday it is so we can rebook.” Kate, Aus

## We Have Options 

If you’ve read this far, we imagine you’re already thinking about what catamaran you want to celebrate on? 

Well, here are our 3 wonderful options. 

We have [three beautiful catamarans](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/) to choose from.  

Check out this page - <https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/> to take a tour of our vessels.

###### SPIRIT OF GWONDA (max 30 guests): 

Our original and signature vessel, the ‘Spirit of Gwonda’ is a Seawind 1050 Resort sailing catamaran that has been purpose-built for entertaining and day cruises. 

Its unique design offers an open plan layout so your guests can interact with each other at all times. The boat also offers all the luxuries you could expect including a front trampoline section for soaking up the sun, generous inside bench seating and a central table with a barbecue. 

###### OCEANS (max 30 guests): 

This is our largest and most luxurious vessel, which comes with a comfortable lounging/dining area with a flexible table configuration. The undercover space has a delightful indoor, outdoor zone that will provide comfort from any weather. 

This vessel is ideal for more relaxed celebrations, families with older kids and more decadent events. So if you’re wanting a party with all the luxurious frills attached, including your own private chef, this catamaran is for you! 

###### SEAWIND 1000XL (max 20 guests): 

This catamaran has a great layout, set out with upholstered booth style seating around a dining table with windows allowing for 360 degrees viewing from all areas. There is extra seating in the targa area at the back, and, as with our other vessels, there is ample area to laze around in the sun on the front trampoline area.
