The foreshore is looking better than ever and with major investments into the beach itself you will enjoy lazing on silky soft golden sand while drying off from a dip in our amazing waters here on the Gold Coast.  Book in with one of the many surf schools and you will be riding a wave like a pro in no time…well we can’t promise that, but it will be fun trying!\r\n\n\r\n\n## Surfers Paradise Night Markets\r\n\nEach Wednesday, Friday and Sunday night, locals, holiday-makers and bargain-hunters make their way to the Surfers Paradise foreshore to wander along the coastal stretch of more than 100 market stalls.    It is a great place to pick up unique products, including fashion, jewellery, accessories, artworks, photographs, beauty products, home wares and services.\r\n\n\r\n\n## Gold Coast Arts Centre\r\n\nThe Arts Centre is located just across Chevron Island at 135 Bundall Road, Surfers Paradise.   The complex houses the Arts Theatre, Gold Coast City Gallery, two Cinemas and the Arts Cafe.   You can catch alternative movies, theatrical performances, bands, comedians and much more.  See their page http://www.theartscentregc.com.au/ for more info.\r\n\n\r\n\n## Infinity\r\n\nInfinity is one of the most popular attractions in Surfers Paradise.  Located on the ground level of the Chevron Renaissance building, it is a mind-blowing 30-minute journey into 20 futuristic, maze-like ‘worlds of wonder’ filled with special effects, atmosphere, sound fields and illusions that go all the way to infinity.   This place is so much fun, with the kids, with some mates, go in with an open mind and experience something new. Visit here.\r\n\n\r\n\n## Grab a coldie…\r\n\nIf like us, when on holiday you prefer to sit back with a great meal, a drink and watch the world go by, Surfers Paradise won’t let you down.  The cuisine on offer in Surfers Paradise is a vast and varied selection and if you like a tipple you will be spoilt for choice.    We suggest checking out theurbanlist.com.au/goldcoast for the latest offerings in the area.\n\n## Catch the G Link\r\n\nThe G Link is the ideal way to reach Surfers Paradise from Parkwood, Southport, Main Beach or Broadbeach.\r\n\n## \r\n\n## Getting to Sailing in Paradise from Surfers Paradise\r\n\nSailing in Paradise departs from Marina Mirage, Main Beach about a 10 minute drive north from Surfers Paradise.   Simply follow the Gold Coast Highway and then turn off before the Sundale Bridge following the signs for Sea World.    Marina Mirage is located on the left and there is ample undercover parking."

If you are looking for the quintessential Gold Coast Beach experience of course at some point you will want to hit Surfers Paradise.   With a whole host of high profile developments in recent years, Surfers Paradise has been given a pretty nice facelift.   So, while once you may have nipped into Surfers to check out the nightlife on Orchid Ave, hunt down a meter maid sporting a legendary gold bikini and have your photo taken in front of the iconic Surfers Paradise Beach sign.  Now you will find enough to keep you occupied, entertained and well fed for a whole day out.



Recent developments in the area include Circle on Cavill, Soul, Hilton and the enormous Jewel development is also underway nearby.  The Soul development added some high-end accommodation right on the beachfront and an array of shops and restaurants beneath which have totally transformed the Surfers Paradise Beach area.
