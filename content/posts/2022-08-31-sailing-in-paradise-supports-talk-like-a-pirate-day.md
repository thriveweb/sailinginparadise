Calling all pirates! Here is your chance to take over your own ship and support Talk Like a
Pirate Day for Childhood Cancer Support. South-East Queensland locals will have the chance
to celebrate Talk Like a Pirate Day on a sailing catamaran on the Gold Coast Broadwater.

Talk Like a Pirate Day is on September 19 and raises much-needed funds for the charity that
provides free accommodation, psychological and emotional support, and transportation services
to receive life-saving treatments for regional families.

Local business, Sailing in Paradise has donated three luxury catamarans for use on Talk Like
a Pirate Day, to help raise vital funds for Childhood Cancer Support. 100% of ticket proceeds on
the day will go towards the charity.

The Sailing in Paradise cruises give a true pirate experience, with a visit to an isolated beach
only accessible via boat (or pirate ship, in this case). This is the perfect opportunity to kick off
school holidays and support Talk Like a Pirate Day with your own shipwrecked adventure.

Sailing in Paradise owner, Steve Buckley is proud to be supporting the cause and helping to
make an impact for regional families facing childhood cancer.
"We are proud to be supporting Childhood Cancer Support by donating the use of our vessels
for fundraising cruises this Talk Like a Pirate Day,” says Steve.
“Personally, knowing so many people affected by cancer and hearing of the tremendous work
of Childhood Cancer Support in helping families going through the unthinkable, we knew we
wanted to help.”

You can purchase your tickets for the Talk Like a Pirate Day cruises [here](cruise/talk-like-a-pirate-day-cruise/) with 100% of the proceeds going to the charity.

Donations can also be made here for those who are unable to attend the cruise but still wish to support this worthy cause.   https://fundraise.ccs.org.au/fundraisers/sailinginparadisegoldcoast
