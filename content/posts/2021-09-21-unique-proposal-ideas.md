Whatever way you choose will go down in history and will be told countless times to your friends and family. If you’d like to make it a memorable and special occasion keep reading for some unique[ boat proposal ideas!](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/boat-charter/gold-coast-romantic-sails/) 

First, you need a location! The Gold Coast Broadwater is an absolutely stunning location with its calm waters, marine life and beautiful city skyline and hinterland backdrop. How does an intimate private charter on the Gold Coast Broadwater for just the two of you sound? Here are a couple of options on how this could go…

## Sail at sunset with a “will you marry me” sail

Imagine taking your future fiancé on board a beautiful sailing yacht and leading him/her towards the front of the [boat](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/) where you will have your own intimate and private picnic setup. Awaiting you both is a large rug, comfortable pillows, blankets and a bottle of bubbles as well as a delicious grazing platter to share. As the boat departs you can enjoy each other's company and relax in comfort together while taking in the beautiful scenery and wildlife around you. 

> Sunset is a beautiful time to be on the water and it’s hard to beat watching the sun dip below the hinterland on the water with your favourite person. 

Whenever you feel the moment is right, you can “give the nod” to your crew who will be looking after you. They will pull the sail out with a “will you marry me” sign on it, ready for your fiancé to see. All you have to do is get on one knee! The “will you marry me sail” is perfect if you're looking for a unique way to propose to your loved one and blow them off their feet! 

Your crew will discreetly capture the moment for you and send you all the photos so you will always have that special and romantic moment frozen in time. We would recommend popping the question sooner rather than later so you can celebrate together, and of course, make the most of that golden hour light in your photos. We always love watching and capturing the reactions as the “will you marry me” sail comes out, it definitely leaves an everlasting impression! You will even get onlookers on nearby boats cheering for you as they see the sail in the wind.

A romantic dinner or drinks after your sail will go down well, the boat's departure point is right next door to some of the Gold Coast's finest waterfront restaurants. Some wonderful options to choose from are Omeros Bros, Glass, Lady Bird, Palazzo Versace and the Sheraton. 



## Romantic picnic brunch option with “will you marry me” written in the sand

If you just can’t hold it in until sunset and want something earlier in the day, a picnic brunch might be more suitable. You can relax in each other’s company on board with an intimate picnic set up to enjoy. The romantic picnic set up offers comfort (cuddle time!) and is complete with a large rug, pillows, blankets, bubbles and a mouth-watering grazing platter to share. Your captain will take you to a secluded island where you can go for a stroll, enjoy your time together and even pop the big question by writing “will you marry me?” in the sand. Sounds dreamy right! 

## Private chef with champagne served with an engagement ring inside the glass

If you want to take it to the next level, how does a private chef sound? Your chef will cook you both up a beautiful 3 course meal as we sail around the stunning Gold Coast Broadwater in total comfort. If you are after a creative and unique proposal idea, how about serving a glass of champagne to your finance with a ring inside the glass. There is no way they will see it coming and it will be an epic story to tell your friends and family!
