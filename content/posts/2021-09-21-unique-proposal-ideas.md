  ## Romantic picnic brunch option with “will you marry me” written in the sand


  If you just can’t hold it in until sunset and want something earlier in the day, a picnic brunch might be more suitable. You can relax in each other’s company on board with an intimate picnic set up to enjoy. The romantic picnic set up offers comfort (cuddle time!) and is complete with a large rug, pillows, blankets, bubbles and a mouth-watering grazing platter to share. Your captain will take you to a secluded island where you can go for a stroll, enjoy your time together and even pop the big question by writing “will you marry me?” in the sand. Sounds dreamy right! 


  ## Private chef with champagne served with an engagement ring inside the glass


  If you want to take it to the next level, how does a private chef sound? Your chef will cook you both up a beautiful 3 course meal as we sail around the stunning Gold Coast Broadwater in total comfort. If you are after a creative and unique proposal idea, how about serving a glass of champagne to your finance with a ring inside the glass. There is no way they will see it coming and it will be an epic story to tell your friends and family!

Imagine taking your future fiancé on board a beautiful sailing yacht and leading him/her towards the front of the [boat](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/) where you will have your own intimate and private picnic setup. Awaiting you both is a large rug, comfortable pillows, blankets and a bottle of bubbles as well as a delicious grazing platter to share.

Your crew will discreetly capture the moment for you and send you all the photos so you will always have that special and romantic moment frozen in time. We would recommend popping the question sooner rather than later so you can celebrate together, and of course, make the most of that golden hour light in your photos. 

We always love watching and capturing the reactions as the “will you marry me” sail comes out, it definitely leaves an everlasting impression! You will even get onlookers on nearby boats cheering for you as they see the sail in the wind.

A romantic dinner or drinks after your sail will go down well, the boat's departure point is right next door to some of the Gold Coast's finest waterfront restaurants. Some wonderful options to choose from are Omeros Bros, Glass, Lady Bird, Palazzo Versace and the Sheraton.
