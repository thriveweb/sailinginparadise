An area close to our hearts, as we call it home!  For such a small suburb Main Beach sure crams some variety into the mix.

Some of our favourite things to do in the Main Beach area include;

**Boating and watersports on the Broadwater!**

Main Beach is the ideal jumping off spot for the Gold Coast Broadwater as you are straight into the action without having to endure the slow cruise through the Gold Coast residential canals.

Hire our Catamaran ‘The Spirit of Gwonda’ in a private boat charter arrangement and you will experience the best the Broadwater has to offer, from clear waters to golden sandy beaches, isolated islands to local wildlife and Surfers Paradise city light views.

You’ll find a whole host of water based activities departing in the Main Beach area including jet boating, jet skiing and parasailing to name a few.  We can help out in arranging these as additional activities on your charter.

**The Sand and the Sea.**

Well it is called ‘Main Beach’ so it would be kind of be rude not mention the beach.

Famed for its open shore break and popular with surfers, Main Beach/Narrow Neck a great spot to pull up the car right alongside the beach for an easy saunter onto the sand.  Bring along some fish and chips from the old bathing pavilion café for a retro treat!  Apart from the Surf Club stretch, you can take a walk along the sand through some more deserted sections of beach and up to the Gold Coast seaway (The Spit) and sand pumping jetty which can make for some spectacular photo opportunities when the lighting is right.

**Family fun at Sea World.**

While there is nothing better than seeing marine wildlife in its natural environment (and we can quite often help you out with that), sometimes the kids are hoping to get up close and personal to really check out the animals.  Sea World offers a great family day out including kids shows and attractions and the ever-popular dolphins as well as penguins and polar bears to name a few.

The Team at Sea World do an amazing job in protecting wildlife on the Gold Coast and are first on call for any injured marine mammals in the region.

**Sails and Superyachts.**

Recently refurbished, and with views over the Broadwater and marinas, the Southport Yacht Club is a good choice for family dining thanks to its varied menu, kid’s playground and cute little private beach area.   We love the Sunset Garden Tapas & Pizza Bar for late afternoon cocktails and yummy wood fired pizzas! And the Rib Eye on the bone is sensational.

**Wine, dine and shop at Marina Mirage**

Marina Mirage is located opposite the Sheraton Mirage and adjacent Palazzo Versace and as you would expect offers an impressive range of retail and dining options.    So, whether you are in search of designer fashions, beautiful homewares or an array of waterfront dining options, Marina Mirage is definitely worth checking out.   The weekly farmers markets are also a good find with delicious local produce on offer within the shopping centre malls.

Sailing in Paradise departs from the Marina Mirage Berths so it is a great idea to pop in before or after your cruise.   For more information check out Marina Mirage here
