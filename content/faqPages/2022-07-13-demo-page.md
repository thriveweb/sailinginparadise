      dropdownContent: No shoes, no worries! We offer a relaxed, barefoot sailing
        experience for your safety and comfort on board. You will be asked to
        slip your shoes off prior to boarding and leave your worries at the
        dock.
    - title: Is smoking permitted on board?
      dropdownContent: To keep our vessels clean and safe, smoking is not permitted
        onboard. However if you have smokers in your group please let our crew
        know on the day and they can organise a smoke stop at the beach or
        jetty.
    - title: Can we BYO food and drinks?
      dropdownContent: Yes, please feel free to bring your own food and drinks on
        board. Please note we don’t allow red wine or straight bottles of
        spirits.
    - title: I am short on time, can you please help me out with catering/drinks?
      dropdownContent: Yes, we offer catering and drinks service for your convenience.
        We offer a range of professionally catered menu options from sandwiches
        and grazing boards, to canapes and private chefs. Please complete our
        enquiry form [here](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/booking-enquiry/)
        to request a copy of our catering menu.
    - title: What type of food do you recommend?
      dropdownContent: >-
        Pre-prepared platters and finger foods are ideal for boat charters.
        Anything that is prepared in advance and then simply unwrapped and
        placed on the table means you can relax and enjoy the charter straight
        away. Easy grazing style food that guests can eat standing (often with a
        drink in the other hand) also works really well. Of course if you prefer
        a more substantial meal this is possible too and we are happy to discuss
        the best way to do this depending on your numbers and which boat

        you are sailing on.
    - title: Is there a BBQ on the boat?
      dropdownContent: Yes! We also provide BBQ tools and oil. Please let us know if
        you are planning to use the BBQ. We recommend min 4 hour charter (if
        BBQ’ing food) if possible as it can take a little time. Ideal BBQ foods
        on board the boat are skewers, sausages and anything that is small and
        cooks quickly.
    - title: Do you have Eskies on board?
      dropdownContent: Yes we do and we also provide ice. The eskies are very large
        and can be used for food or drink.
    - title: Is glass allowed on board?
      dropdownContent: Bottled drinks like champagne and beer are OK. Any cups do need
        to be non-breakable please.
    - title: Do you have speakers/music on board?
      dropdownContent: All of our vessels have inbuilt sound systems with speakers
        indoors and on the front deck. We also have an iPad with premium Spotify
        account for our guests to use, so you can either make a playlist or
        choose your fave tunes on the day :-)
    - title: Where can we go on our charter?
      dropdownContent: >-
        We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold Coast Broadwater.
        Where to go very much depends on what you would like to do and how long
        your boat charter is for, so please feel free to discuss this with our
        team. In a 3 hour daytime charter, our guests usually love a swim stop
        at

        Wavebreak Island where you can enjoy the range of island activities carried on board. Your skipper is knowledgeable in the local area and will make recommendations based on the conditions on the day. If you don't wish to swim in a 3 hour charter you can instead opt to sail further north along the inside of South Stradbroke Island and see the millionaires mansions at Sovereign Island. It is also often possible to add additional hours when booking your charter to allow extra time to see the sights, swim or enjoy a leisurely lunch on board.



        Guests booking an evening sail will take in views of the sunset over the mountains, this is the most stunning time to be on the water. The city lights of Surfers Paradise, Main Beach and Southport after dark are equally beautiful from the water.
    - title: What activities do you carry on board?
      dropdownContent: We carry a range of activities on board which may include Stand
        Up Paddle Boards, Inflatables, Float Mats, Beach Volleyball, Beach
        Cricket, Beach Toys etc. These are available for your use free of charge
        during your charter.
    - title: Do you provide snorkelling equipment?
      dropdownContent: We do not provide snorkelling equipment but you are welcome to
        bring some along if you wish.
    - title: Do your charters come with crew?
      dropdownContent: Yes! All charters come with a skipper (to drive the vessel) and
        cruise host to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for our guests.
        Our crew are professional yet fun and will make you feel at home on
        board.
    - title: Are your vessels a good choice for photoshoots, family photos or that
        perfect insta pic?
      dropdownContent: >-
        What could be a better photo backdrop than clear waters, sandy beaches
        and a stylish yacht? Our vessels are the perfect photo backdrop and have
        in fact been used by major retailers, clothing brands and international
        magazines as a shoot location! What’s more our crew will capture photo

        memories during your charter to be shared with you after you sail.
    - title: How do I pick the best vessel to suit my group from your fleet?
      dropdownContent: We recommend checking out the ‘[Our
        Boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)’ page on our website
        to view details of each vessel as well as the VR 360 Tours. There are
        also video walk throughs on our Instagram Stories Highlights. If you are
        in any doubt please feel free to email or call us and we will be happy
        to discuss which vessel may be the most suitable for your group.
    - title: Will I get seasick?
      dropdownContent: Nope! We operate in the calm, protected waters of the Gold
        Coast Broadwater. We do not go offshore (into the open ocean) so we do
        not experience large ocean swells. Our catamarans are very stable, and
        do not have the same side to side rocking motion as experienced by
        single hull vessels so you won't get seasick :-).
    - title: Can you pick me up from a house on the canal in Surfers
        Paradise/Broadbeach?
      dropdownContent: We are unable to fit under the bridges so unfortunately this is
        not possible. Having said that, most of our guests like to sail out on
        the wide (yet protected) expanse of water called the Gold Coast
        Broadwater (rather than in the canals). Departing from Main Beach
        ensures you reach the islands, beaches and best sunset views much more
        quickly, so it is better use of your charter time.
    - title: Do you actually sail?
      dropdownContent: Yes! Our crew love getting the sails up (conditions permitting)
        and can normally hoist the sails in at least one direction. Please let
        us know when booking (or on boarding the vessel) if sailing is an
        important part of your charter so we can brief our crew accordingly.
    - title: What happens if it rains?
      dropdownContent: First of all remember...a little rain doesn't stop a great time
        on our boats. But do rest assured that we have a very generous wet
        weather policy as we want you to enjoy your time on board the boat, so
        if there is torrential rain or storms at the time you will be able to
        cancel or reschedule your cruise. Please [click
        here](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/bookings-and-cancellation-policy/)
        to see our booking T&Cs which include weather terms.
    - title: Are your charters suitable for children?
      dropdownContent: >-
        Absolutely! We love having kids on board and our crew are happy to
        include them in hoisting the sails and manning the helm (which can make
        for some cute family photos). We also carry a range of beach games
        suitable for kids including buckets and spades for the littlest family
        members. The wide and spacious deck areas also make the boats a
        wonderful choice for families with kids. Please feel free to contact our
        team if you have any questions about which boat may be best for your

        family.
    - title: Are your charters suitable for guests with limited mobility?
      dropdownContent: We have welcomed several guests on board with limited mobility.
        However, given each individual is different in terms of ability we
        request that guests with specific mobility requirements contact us to
        discuss. Please take a look at the virtual reality 360 tours on the
        '[Our Boats](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/our-boats/)' page to help
        understand the layout of our vessels. Please bear in mind that a big
        step up (or carry) is often required to board the boats at the marina.
        Our friendly team will be happy to discuss further to ensure you and
        your guests are comfortable prior to making a booking.
    - title: Can I celebrate a special occasion on board?
      dropdownContent: Absolutely!! We are there for all of the special occasions in
        your life and have hosted birthdays (of all ages), hen’s parties, baby
        showers, proposals, weddings, anniversaries as well as memorial
        charters. We also host corporate events and Christmas parties!
    - title: Do you operate on Christmas Day?
      dropdownContent: We do not operate on Christmas Day but we are open on Christmas
        Eve, Boxing Day and every other day of the year :-)
    - title: Do you operate on New Year’s Eve/Day?
      dropdownContent: Yes, we offer sails all day on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s
        Day. Charters over midnight may be available on request. Please [contact
        us](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/booking-enquiry/) for further
        information.
    - title: Why should we book with you over another operator?
      dropdownContent: When booking a charter boat it is advisable to book directly
        with the vessel owner as this removes the risk of double bookings and
        ensures seamless communications as well as the best possible rate for
        your charter. When selecting a vessel it is important to consider the
        suitability of the vessel and how this will work for your group (think
        layout, capability of beach landings, stability, space, speed etc), in
        addition to additional services offered by the charter operator and
        crewing. Other guest experiences are always a great resource to assist
        in your decision making. Sailing in Paradise owns all vessels within its
        fleet, 360 Tours of our vessels are available online and all vessels are
        capable of beach landings on the many sandy shores of the Gold Coast
        Broadwater. Please take a moment to read our guest reviews online, check
        out our socials or speak to someone who has sailed with us before. Guest
        satisfaction is so important to us, we are proud to have a plethora of
        five star reviews and many, many return guests. We're not happy unless
        you're happy and we want you to come back again and again. We can blow
        our own trumpet from time to time right? :-)
    - title: How do I book?
      dropdownContent: Click [here](https://sailinginparadise.com.au/booking-enquiry/)
        to fill out an enquiry form and you will quickly get all the info you
        need including availability, pricing, inclusions etc. You can also book
        online! Then it is simply a matter of paying your deposit to secure your
        preferred date. But don't dawdle as we quickly book out and we don't
        want you to be disappointed.
